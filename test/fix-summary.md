# Journal Entry Fixes Summary

## 1. Date Timezone Shift Fix

### Problem
Journal entries created with a specific date were sometimes shifted by one day when stored or displayed, due to timezone conversion issues.

### Root Cause
The journal entry date was being stored as a timestamp with timezone information, which caused date shifts when the date was processed in different timezones or when there were timezone offsets.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Database Schema Update**:
   - Modified the journal_entries.date column from 'timestamp without time zone' to 'DATE' type using the migration script `migrations/2025-05-je_date.sql`
   - This ensures dates are stored without time components, eliminating timezone shift issues

2. **Validation Updates**:
   - Updated schema validation in `shared/validation.ts` to:
     - Use regex pattern `/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/` to validate YYYY-MM-DD format
     - Handle conversion from Date objects to YYYY-MM-DD strings using date-fns
     - Add additional refinements to ensure the date is valid

3. **Regression Tests**:
   - Created `test/unit/jeDate.test.ts` to verify:
     - Proper validation of YYYY-MM-DD string inputs
     - Correct conversion of Date objects to YYYY-MM-DD strings
     - Rejection of invalid date formats
     - Consistency in date-fns formatting

## 2. File Attachment Permissions Fix

### Problem
File attachments could not be deleted when a journal entry was in 'pending_approval' status, preventing users from managing attachments during the approval process.

### Root Cause
The UI logic in JournalEntryDetail.tsx was only showing the file upload and delete functionality for journal entries in 'draft' status, not including 'pending_approval' status.

### Solution Implemented
1. **UI Updates**:
   - Modified `client/src/features/journal-entries/pages/JournalEntryDetail.tsx` to:
     - Show file delete button for both 'draft' AND 'pending_approval' statuses
     - Maintained the same UI style and confirmation dialog
     - Verified that file upload area was already properly configured for both statuses

2. **Regression Tests**:
   - Created `test/unit/jeDraftAttachment.test.ts` to verify:
     - File deletion is permitted for 'draft' status
     - File deletion is permitted for 'pending_approval' status
     - File deletion is prohibited for other statuses ('approved', 'posted', 'rejected', 'void')

## Verification
1. **SQL Verification**:
   - Confirmed column type change: The journal_entries.date column is now of type 'date'
   
2. **Manual Testing Steps**:
   - Created `test/manual-verification.md` with detailed steps to verify:
     - Journal entry date consistency across create/update operations
     - File attachment functionality in different journal entry statuses
     - Cross-browser compatibility
