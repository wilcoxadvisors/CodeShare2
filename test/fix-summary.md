# Fix Summary

This document summarizes the fixes implemented for the journal entry date timezone issues and file attachment permissions.

## Journal Entry Date Timezone Issue

### Problem Description
Journal entry dates were experiencing timezone shifts during create/update operations. When a user selected a specific date (e.g., May 1, 2025), the system would sometimes store it as the previous or next day depending on the user's timezone, leading to inconsistent date display.

### Root Cause
1. The `date` column in the `journal_entries` table was defined as a `timestamp without time zone` type, which includes both date and time components.
2. During validation, JavaScript's `new Date()` constructor was used, which applies local timezone conversions when parsing date strings.
3. When retrieving the date for display, timezone-specific formatting was applied, potentially shifting the date by Â±1 day.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Database Layer**: 
   - Modified the `date` column to use the PostgreSQL `DATE` type (without time component)
   - Added a column comment explicitly stating the purpose: "Date of the journal entry (DATE type, without time component to avoid timezone issues)"

2. **Schema Layer**:
   - Verified `date: date("date").notNull()` usage in the Drizzle schema
   - Ensured that the DATE type is properly imported and used

3. **Validation Layer**:
   - Removed all instances of `new Date()` conversions in validation preprocessors
   - Implemented string-based validation using regex pattern matching for YYYY-MM-DD format
   - Eliminated date parsing and timezone conversion during validation

4. **Storage/Routes Layer**:
   - Modified API routes to handle date fields as simple strings in YYYY-MM-DD format
   - Ensured date filter parameters (startDate, endDate) are handled as strings

5. **Frontend Layer**:
   - Maintained consistent string format (YYYY-MM-DD) for dates when sending to the API
   - Used date-specific UI components that handle the display formatting appropriately

### Testing
1. Created `jeDate.test.ts` to verify:
   - Date strings are preserved exactly as submitted
   - Date filtering works correctly
   - Date remains unchanged during update operations
   - Direct database queries confirm the correct storage format

2. Manual testing steps provided in `manual-verification.md`

## File Attachment Permissions Issue

### Problem Description
File attachments could not be added or deleted for journal entries in "pending_approval" status, even though business rules specify this should be allowed. The system only permitted file operations for entries in "draft" status.

### Root Cause
1. The permission checks for file operations were only allowing "draft" status, excluding "pending_approval"
2. This restriction was inconsistently implemented between frontend and backend

### Solution Implemented
1. **Backend Layer**:
   - Updated permission checks in file routes to include both 'draft' and 'pending_approval' statuses
   - Maintained restriction against file operations for journal entries with other statuses (posted, approved, etc.)

2. **Frontend Layer**:
   - Modified file upload components to enable when status is either 'draft' or 'pending_approval'
   - Updated file deletion UI controls with the same status checks

### Testing
1. Created `jeAttachment.test.ts` to verify:
   - Files can be uploaded to journal entries in 'draft' status
   - Files can be uploaded to journal entries in 'pending_approval' status
   - Files cannot be uploaded to journal entries in 'posted' status
   - File deletion works for both 'draft' and 'pending_approval' statuses

2. Manual testing steps provided in `manual-verification.md`

## Migration Safety

The migration to change the date column type is designed to be:
1. Idempotent - safe to run multiple times
2. Non-destructive - preserves existing date values
3. Compatible - works with existing code that expects date strings

The migration includes specific checks to avoid re-running if the column is already the correct type.
