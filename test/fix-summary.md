# Fix Summary: Journal Entry Date and File Permission Issues

## Issue 1: Journal Entry Date Format/Timezone Problems

### Root Cause
Journal entry dates were stored as timestamps with timezone information, leading to inconsistencies when displaying and editing dates. This caused dates to shift by one day in some cases when a user edited an entry.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Database Schema Change**:
   - Created migration `2025-05-je_date.sql` to convert the `journal_entries.date` column from `TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE` to `DATE` type
   - Added column comment for documentation

2. **Code Changes**:
   - Updated schema.ts to properly import and use the DATE type
   - Simplified date processing in validation.ts to consistently use YYYY-MM-DD format strings
   - Modified journalEntryRoutes.ts to handle date filters as string values
   - Updated reverseJournalEntry function to handle dates correctly

3. **Format Standardization**:
   - Standardized on YYYY-MM-DD format for all date representations
   - Eliminated unnecessary date conversions to prevent timezone shifts

## Issue 2: Journal Entry File Permissions

### Root Cause
The UI logic in JournalEntryDetail.tsx was only showing the file upload and delete functionality for journal entries in 'draft' status, not including 'pending_approval' status.

### Solution Implemented
1. **UI Updates**:
   - Modified `client/src/features/journal-entries/pages/JournalEntryDetail.tsx` to:
     - Show file delete button for both 'draft' AND 'pending_approval' statuses
     - Maintained the same UI style and confirmation dialog
     - Verified that file upload area was already properly configured for both statuses

2. **Regression Tests**:
   - Created `test/unit/jeDraftAttachment.test.ts` to verify:
     - File deletion is permitted for 'draft' status
     - File deletion is permitted for 'pending_approval' status
     - File deletion is prohibited for other statuses ('approved', 'posted', 'rejected', 'void')

## Verification
1. **SQL Verification**:
   - Confirmed column type change: The journal_entries.date column is now of type 'date'
   
2. **Manual Testing Steps**:
   - Created `test/manual-verification.md` with detailed steps to verify:
     - Journal entry date consistency across create/update operations
     - File attachment functionality in different journal entry statuses
     - Cross-browser compatibility

## Implementation Notes
- All changes are non-disruptive to existing data
- No schema changes were required for file permissions (only UI logic)
- The date migration is safe to run multiple times (checks first if migration is needed)
- These fixes maintain backward compatibility with existing workflows
