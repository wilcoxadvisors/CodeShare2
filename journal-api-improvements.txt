# Journal Entry API Improvements

## Current Status

The Journal Entry API currently is missing a proper DELETE endpoint and has inconsistent validation.

## Implementation Plan

1. Add DELETE Endpoint
2. Improve POST and PUT Validation
3. Standardize API Design

## Testing Strategy

1. Create unit tests for the new DELETE endpoint
2. Update unit tests for POST and PUT endpoints
3. Create integration tests with valid and invalid inputs
4. Create a test script to verify all endpoints
