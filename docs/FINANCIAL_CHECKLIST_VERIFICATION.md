### Verification Details
- **Issue Fixed**: Corrected the server routes (`formRoutes.ts`) to properly use the namespaced storage approach (`storage.forms.methodName()` instead of direct `storage.methodName()`)
- **Form Submission**: Successfully tested form submission with test data on 2025-04-06
- **Database Verification**: Confirmed submission data was correctly saved to the `checklist_submissions` table
- **PDF Download**: Verified PDF file was served automatically after submission
- **Email Notification**: Confirmed email notification was sent to admin email
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Verified component uses responsive design elements through Tailwind CSS

### Storage Access Pattern Corrections

The following issues were identified and fixed:

1. **Blog Subscriber Operations**:
   - Fixed `updateBlogSubscriber` call to use correct namespace
   - Fixed `deleteBlogSubscriber` call to use correct namespace

2. **Form Operations**:
   - All checklist operations now correctly access storage through proper namespacing
   - Verified data successfully stores in the database after the fix

### Database Verification

The latest checklist submission was confirmed in the database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM checklist_submissions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

```
id,name,email,company,revenue_range,ip_address,user_agent,status,created_at

```

This verification confirms that the form submission process is now working correctly from end to end.
