# Project Organization Cleanup Report

## Overview
This report outlines the cleanup and organization efforts performed on the Wilcox Advisors Accounting System project to improve maintainability and file structure.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Report Files Organization
- Moved all issue fix and feature implementation reports to `docs/reports/` folder
- Consolidated documentation in the `docs/` directory
- Verification status documentation moved to `docs/` folder

### 2. Verification and Test Scripts Organization
- Moved all verification scripts and test files to `verification-scripts/` folder
- Consolidated test runners and verification utilities
- Organized related test data files

### 3. Backup and Log Files
- Moved backup files to `backup/` folder
- Organized log files in `logs/` directory
- Consolidated cleanup reports in `cleanup_report/` folder

### 4. Static Assets
- Organized static assets like images
- Moved icon to `public/images/` directory for proper web serving

## Results
The project root directory is now significantly cleaner, with only essential configuration and setup files remaining at the top level. This organization improves:

1. **Code maintainability**: Related files are grouped together
2. **Project navigation**: Clearer directory structure makes finding files easier
3. **Development workflow**: Test and verification scripts are properly organized
4. **Documentation access**: All reports and documentation are in centralized locations

## Directory Structure
The main project structure now follows a more organized pattern with:

- Configuration files at root level
- Code organized in functional directories
- Documentation and reports in dedicated folders
- Test and verification assets properly segregated

The application functionality remains unchanged after reorganization.
