Final Migration Validation Checklist
🛠️ 1. Database Integrity Checks
 Ensure no lingering references in the junction table (consolidation_group_entities) point to invalid, inactive, or deleted entities:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM consolidation_group_entities cge
LEFT JOIN entities e ON cge.entity_id = e.id
WHERE e.id IS NULL OR e.active = false;
Expected: Zero rows.

 Confirm the legacy entity_ids arrays no longer contain active data (optional, but recommended for validation):

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT id FROM consolidation_groups WHERE entity_ids IS NOT NULL AND array_length(entity_ids, 1) > 0;
Expected: Ideally zero rows or only deprecated historical data.

📌 2. Backend API Testing
 Test all CRUD operations through backend APIs:

Create consolidation group

Add/remove entities

Fetch consolidation groups (by user, by entity, etc.)

Generate consolidated reports (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, etc.)

 Verify junction table usage exclusively (enable logging temporarily to validate database queries if necessary).

🎯 3. Frontend Integration Testing
 Test Admin Dashboard thoroughly:

Ensure entity selection, addition, and removal work seamlessly.

Verify immediate UI reflection of changes.

Check stability with various edge cases (e.g., adding/removing rapidly, empty groups).

 Review the frontend console logs for any unexpected warnings or errors related to the migration.

🔍 4. Comprehensive End-to-End Testing
 Perform complete end-to-end testing scenarios, including:

Creating new consolidation groups.

Modifying entities within groups via Admin UI.

Generating reports and ensuring data accuracy.

Checking persistence and consistency after page refresh or re-login.
