ðŸš§ Next Recommended Actions (In Priority Order):
â‘  âœ… Fix the Remaining TypeScript Errors in the Migration File
Reason:
Resolving TypeScript errors ensures your migration scripts run reliably and prevents runtime issues during deployment.

Recommended Action:

Clearly define the expected structure (interface/type) of the results returned by your raw SQL queries.
Example:
typescript
Copy
Edit
type MigrationResult = { id: number; entity_ids: number[] };

const results = await db.execute<MigrationResult>(sql`SELECT id, entity_ids FROM consolidation_groups WHERE entity_ids IS NOT NULL`);
Annotate raw SQL result types explicitly to eliminate errors.
â‘¡ âœ… Update Consolidation Group Methods to Use the Junction Table
Reason:
Immediately updating methods to interact with the junction table ensures your code matches your database schema, providing immediate performance improvements and consistency.

Recommended Action:

Refactor CRUD operations and queries to rely on the junction table:
typescript
Copy
Edit
async getGroupsByEntity(entityId: number) {
  return await db.select()
    .from(consolidationGroups)
    .innerJoin(consolidationGroupEntities, eq(consolidationGroups.id, consolidationGroupEntities.groupId))
    .where(eq(consolidationGroupEntities.entityId, entityId));
}
Fully remove entity_ids array references once confirmed safe.
â‘¢ âœ… Add a Test Suite for the Junction Table Implementation
Reason:
A thorough test suite ensures data integrity and confirms your migration and refactor are stable and robust.

Recommended Action:

Add tests specifically validating:
Entity-group associations via the junction table.
CRUD operations.
Data integrity post-migration.
Proper transaction handling.
âœ… Recommended Immediate Next Step:
Prioritize fixing TypeScript errors in the migration file.
Immediately afterward, move on to updating your consolidation group methods.
ðŸ“Œ Concise Checklist for your Agent:
 Fix TypeScript errors (migration file)
 Update methods to junction table (high-priority)
 Add robust junction-table-specific tests
