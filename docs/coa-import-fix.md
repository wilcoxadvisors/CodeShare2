# Chart of Accounts Code Field Inconsistency Fix

## Overview

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address the inconsistency between the "code" and "accountCode" fields in the Chart of Accounts functionality.

## Background

The database schema was updated to use "accountCode" as the field name for the unique identifier of accounts, but there were still instances in the code that were referring to "code" instead. This inconsistency caused issues in the import/export functionality and data display.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema

- Confirmed that shared/schema.ts uses "accountCode" as the field name for the account code
- Removed any legacy references to "code" in the schema

### 2. Backend Storage Layer

- Updated accountStorage.ts to consistently use "accountCode" in all CRUD operations
- Removed backward compatibility code that was handling both "code" and "accountCode"
- Fixed field mapping in import/export functions to use "accountCode" consistently

### 3. API Routes

- Updated accountRoutes.ts to ensure all routes use "accountCode" in request/response handling
- Fixed validation logic to validate using "accountCode" field

### 4. Frontend Components

- Updated ChartOfAccounts.tsx to use "accountCode" consistently in the UI
- Fixed table column definitions to display "accountCode" instead of "code"
- Updated import/export functions to handle "accountCode" properly

### 5. Import/Export Functionality

- Fixed CSV and Excel export to include "AccountCode" as the column name
- Updated import logic to expect "AccountCode" in the uploaded files
- Fixed preview functionality to display the correct field mapping

## Test Approach

To verify the fixes, we implemented a comprehensive testing approach:

1. Created a test client and entity
2. Prepared test import files (valid-accounts.csv, duplicate-codes.csv, invalid-parents.csv)
3. Developed a test script that verifies import validation and export field naming
4. Documented test procedures for manual verification

## Results

- Import functionality now correctly validates using the "accountCode" field
- Export functionality generates files with "AccountCode" as the column name
- UI displays the account code consistently using "accountCode"
- Parent-child relationships are properly established based on "accountCode"/"parentCode"

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring for any remaining instances of "code" in the codebase
2. Consider adding automated tests to prevent regression
3. Update end-user documentation to reflect the correct field naming
