# Issue 3: Form Reset When Deleting Unsaved Entities (Fix Report)

## Issue
Deleting an unsaved entity resets the entire form unexpectedly.

## Root Cause
Incorrect state handling during entity deletion. The entity deletion logic was only notifying the parent component through `onEntityDeleted(id)` but not explicitly updating the local state `setupEntities`. This was causing inconsistent state between the parent component and the EntityManagementCard component.

## Resolution
- Updated entity deletion handler to explicitly filter out the deleted entity from the local state:
```javascript
// Update local state to remove the entity
setSetupEntities((prevEntities) => prevEntities.filter(entity => 
  (entity.localId !== id && entity.id !== id)
));

// Notify parent component of the deletion
onEntityDeleted(id);
```

- The fix handles both regular entities (with ID) and temporary entities (with localId).
- The form state is now properly preserved when an entity is deleted.

## Testing Performed
- Explicitly tested deleting a single unsaved entity: only that entity is removed.
- Verified that other entity entries remain unaffected.
- Confirmed the rest of the form (client details, etc.) remains populated.
- Verified no unintended form resets occur when deleting entities.

## Results
âœ… Issue resolved. Form no longer resets when entities are deleted.

## Technical Details
The key improvement is the explicit removal of the entity from the local state using a filter function that checks both the `id` and `localId` properties. This ensures that both persisted and temporary entities can be properly removed without affecting the rest of the form state.
