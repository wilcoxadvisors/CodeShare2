# Implementation Summary: Entity Code Format and Soft Deletion

## Entity Code Standardization

### Objective
Standardize entity codes to use a 4-digit format for the sequential part, enhancing readability and allowing for up to 9,999 entities per client.

### Implementation
1. ✅ Updated the `generateUniqueEntityCode` function in `server/storage/entityStorage.ts` to use 4-digit padding
2. ✅ Created a migration script `scripts/update_existing_entity_codes_4digit.ts` to update any legacy 3-digit codes
3. ✅ Verified that all entity codes in the database use the correct 4-digit format
4. ✅ Created comprehensive test scripts to validate entity code generation
5. ✅ Documented the entity code format and generation process

### Verification
- Ran `test-entity-code-generation.ts` to confirm proper entity code generation
- Validated that the code correctly handles the 4-digit format with zero-padding
- Confirmed entity codes follow the pattern: `{ClientCode}-{0001-9999}`

## Soft Deletion and Restoration

### Objective
Implement comprehensive soft deletion and restoration functionality for both clients and entities, preserving data while allowing for graceful recovery.

### Implementation
1. ✅ Added `deletedAt` timestamp columns to clients and entities tables
2. ✅ Created audit logs table to track deletion and restoration actions
3. ✅ Implemented soft deletion methods in client and entity storage modules
4. ✅ Added restoration functionality to recover soft-deleted records
5. ✅ Modified query methods to filter deleted records by default
6. ✅ Added `includeDeleted` parameter to optionally include deleted records in queries
7. ✅ Created comprehensive test scripts to validate soft deletion and restoration functionality

### Verification
- Ran `test-client-deletion-filtering.ts` to verify proper filtering of deleted clients
- Ran `test-entity-deletion-filtering.ts` to verify proper filtering of deleted entities
- Ran `test-entity-restore.ts` to verify restoration functionality works correctly
- Confirmed audit logs are created for all deletion and restoration actions

## Documentation
- Created detailed documentation in `docs/reports/auto-generated-entity-code-feature-report.md`
- Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/reports/soft-deletion-restore-functionality-report.md`
- Added inline documentation in code with clear comments explaining implementation details

## Benefits
1. **Scalability**: 4-digit entity codes support up to 9,999 entities per client
2. **Consistency**: All entity codes follow the same format for better readability
3. **Data Preservation**: Soft deletion preserves historical data while keeping interfaces clean
4. **Recoverability**: Restoration functionality allows recovery from accidental deletions
5. **Audit Trail**: All actions are logged for accountability and tracking
6. **Code Safety**: Entity codes remain unique even after deletion/restoration

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing bulk deletion/restoration capabilities for multiple records
- Add user interface components for viewing/managing deleted records
- Implement automatic purging of long-deleted records (true deletion after a configurable time period)
- Add more granular restoration permissions
