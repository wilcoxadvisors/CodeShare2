# Soft Deletion and Restore Functionality Report

## Overview
The Wilcox Advisors accounting system has been enhanced with soft deletion capabilities for both clients and entities. This approach allows administrators to "delete" records from normal view without permanently removing them from the database, preserving data integrity while maintaining a clean user interface. Additionally, restoration functionality allows authorized administrators to recover previously deleted records when needed.

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
Both the `clients` and `entities` tables have been updated with:
- `deletedAt` timestamp column (nullable): Records the time when a record was soft-deleted
- `active` boolean column: Used to explicitly mark records as active (true) or inactive (false)

### Audit Logging
All deletion and restoration actions are tracked in the `audit_logs` table with:
- Admin ID (who performed the action)
- Action type (e.g., "DELETE_CLIENT", "RESTORE_ENTITY")
- Timestamp
- Details JSON (containing the affected record IDs and additional context)

### Core Functionality

#### Soft Deletion
When a client or entity is "deleted":
1. The `deletedAt` timestamp is set to the current time
2. The `active` flag is set to `false`
3. An audit log entry is created
4. The record remains in the database but is filtered from standard queries

#### Restoration
When a client or entity is restored:
1. The `deletedAt` timestamp is set back to `null`
2. The `active` flag is set to `true`
3. An audit log entry is created
4. The record becomes visible in standard queries again

### Implementation in Storage Modules

#### Client Storage
- `deleteClient(id, adminId)`: Performs soft deletion of a client
- `restoreClient(id, adminId)`: Restores a previously deleted client
- `getClients(includeDeleted = false)`: Retrieves clients with option to include deleted records
- All other retrieval methods support the `includeDeleted` parameter

#### Entity Storage
- `deleteEntity(id, adminId)`: Performs soft deletion of an entity
- `restoreEntity(id, adminId)`: Restores a previously deleted entity
- `getEntities(includeDeleted = false)`: Retrieves entities with option to include deleted records
- All other retrieval methods support the `includeDeleted` parameter

## Query Behavior
- Default behavior: All standard queries automatically filter out soft-deleted records
- Optional inclusion: All query methods accept an `includeDeleted` parameter to optionally include soft-deleted records
- Direct access: Records can still be accessed directly by ID regardless of deletion status

## Benefits
1. **Data Preservation**: Historical data remains in the database for reference and potential future use
2. **Recoverability**: Accidentally deleted records can be restored without data loss
3. **Clean Interface**: Users only see active records during normal operation
4. **Audit Trail**: All deletion and restoration actions are tracked for accountability
5. **Code Safety**: Entity and client codes remain unique even after deletion, preventing code reuse conflicts

## Front-end Integration
The user interface has been updated to:
- Filter out deleted records in standard views
- Provide admin interfaces to view deleted records
- Offer restore functionality for administrators to recover deleted records

## Verification
The implementation has been rigorously tested with:
- Unit tests for both deletion and restoration functionality
- Verification of proper filtering in all query methods
- Confirmation of audit logging for all actions
- End-to-end testing of the complete delete-restore workflow

## Future Enhancements
Potential future improvements could include:
- Automatic purging of long-deleted records (true deletion after a configurable time period)
- More granular restoration permissions
- Bulk deletion/restoration capabilities for multiple records
