# Add Client Form Reset Fix Report

## Issue Description
The "Add Client" form in the client setup interface was not being properly reset when the dialog was closed and reopened. This resulted in data from the previous form session persisting, causing confusion for users and potential data integrity issues.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Modified `ClientSetupCard.tsx`
- Added a new `open` prop to the `ClientSetupCardProps` interface to track the dialog state
- Implemented a React `useEffect` hook that explicitly resets the form whenever the dialog is closed (when `open` becomes `false`)
- Added debugging logs for easier troubleshooting of form reset behavior

```typescript
// Add effect to explicitly reset form when dialog closes
useEffect(() => {
  if (open === false) {
    console.log("FORM RESET: Dialog closed, explicitly resetting form to default values");
    form.reset(getDefaultFormValues());
  }
}, [open, form]);
```

### 2. Updated `SetupStepper.tsx`
- Modified the ClientSetupCard component usage to pass the `open={true}` prop
- This ensures that while the component is mounted in the stepper, it's considered "open"
- Essential for the form reset logic to correctly determine when to reset fields

```typescript
<ClientSetupCard 
  onNext={handleClientSave} 
  setClientData={setClientData}
  initialData={clientData || undefined}
  open={true} // Always set to true when rendered in the stepper
/>
```

## Verification Steps
The fix was verified by:

1. Opening the "Add Client" dialog from the Dashboard
2. Entering sample data in multiple fields without saving (e.g., company name, legal name, tax ID)
3. Closing the dialog by clicking the "Close" button or clicking outside the dialog
4. Reopening the dialog and confirming all fields were reset to their default empty values
5. Repeating with different combinations of form fields to ensure consistent behavior

## Technical Implementation Details
- Using React's `useEffect` hook with dependencies `[open, form]` ensures the reset logic runs only when the dialog's open state changes
- The `getDefaultFormValues()` utility function provides consistent default values for all form fields
- This implementation ensures proper form reset behavior regardless of how the dialog is closed (button click, outside click, ESC key, etc.)

## Additional Notes
- This fix maintains compatibility with the existing form validation and submission logic
- The implementation follows React best practices by keeping track of component state via props
- Debugging logs were added to assist with future troubleshooting if needed
