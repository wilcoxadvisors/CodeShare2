# Prepopulated Unsaved Entities Issue Fix Report

## Issue Description
When entering the Entities setup step for a new client, the form shows prepopulated entities (unsaved data). Users must manually delete these entries each time they set up a new client.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was occurring due to React state persistence between component mounts. The `EntityManagementCard` component was initializing its entity state from props (`entities`) with a fallback to an empty array, but once the component had entities added, this state was persisting even when creating new clients.

Specific issues identified:
1. The initial entity state was set using `entities || []` which preserved stale data between component remounts
2. The component wasn't explicitly clearing the entity state when a new client setup began
3. Multiple useEffect hooks were interacting with each other, causing confusion about when entities should be reset

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Initial State Reset
Modified the initial state to always start with an empty array instead of using the entities prop:
```tsx
// FIXED: Always initialize with empty array to prevent persisting unsaved entities
// Don't use entities prop directly in initial state to avoid persisting unsaved data
const [setupEntities, setSetupEntities] = useState<any[]>([]);
```

### 2. Explicit State Reset When New Client Setup Starts
Updated the useEffect that handles client data changes to explicitly reset entity state when a new client setup is detected:
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Reset the form whenever clientData changes
  form.reset(getDefaultFormValues());
  
  // FIXED: Reset entities state when setting up a new client (no ID)
  if (!clientData || !clientData.id) {
    console.log("CLIENT RESET: New client setup detected, clearing all entity state");
    setSetupEntities([]);
    return; // No need to try to fetch entities for a new client
  }
  
  // For existing clients with IDs, load their entities
  // ...rest of function...
}, [clientData, form, entityData]);
```

### 3. Consistent State Management
Ensured all entity state updates consistently handle errors and edge cases:
- Always set `setSetupEntities([])` when errors occur
- Explicitly handle the case of new client setup (no clientId)
- Prevent stale data from showing when switching between clients

## Testing and Verification

The fix has been verified to work correctly in the following scenarios:
1. ✅ When starting a new client setup, the entity list starts empty
2. ✅ When adding entities during client setup, they appear in the list
3. ✅ When switching between different clients, the correct entities for each client are displayed
4. ✅ No unsaved entities appear when navigating back to the entity setup step

## Impact
This fix improves the user experience by:
1. Eliminating the need to manually delete unwanted entities during new client setup
2. Ensuring clean state when starting fresh client setup
3. Maintaining proper entity-client relationships
4. Reducing user confusion and potential data entry errors

## Additional Considerations
- The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing code
- No API or database changes were required
- The solution focuses on the frontend state management issue
