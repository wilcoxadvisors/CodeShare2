# Client Legal Name Field Bug Fix Report

## Issue Description
Users have reported that the "Client Legal Name" field is not being saved properly when creating or updating clients. The field appears in the UI forms but the data is lost when submitted.

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigating the issue, we discovered:
1. The `legalName` field was present in the UI components and form validation schemas 
2. However, the field was missing from the database schema definition in `shared/schema.ts`
3. This caused the field to be:
   - Present in form submissions
   - Available in the UI
   - But lost when stored in the database, as the column didn't exist

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Schema Update
Added the `legalName` field to the clients table schema in `shared/schema.ts`:
```typescript
export const clients = pgTable("clients", {
  // Existing fields...
  legalName: text("legal_name"),
  // Other fields...
});
```

### 2. Database Migration
Created a migration file to add the missing column to the existing database:
```sql
-- File: migrations/0002_add_legal_name_to_clients.sql
ALTER TABLE clients ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS legal_name TEXT;
```

### 3. Client Storage Implementation
Ensured the `legalName` field is properly handled in the `ClientStorage` implementation:
- For database operations: The field now properly maps to the `legal_name` column
- For in-memory storage: Added `legalName` handling in the `MemClientStorage` implementation

### 4. Form Validation 
Confirmed that the existing form validation schemas (`ClientOnboardingForm` and `ClientEditForm`) already included the `legalName` field.

## Testing
1. Verified that new clients can be created with a legal name value
2. Verified that existing clients can have their legal name updated
3. Created automated tests in `test/client-legal-name-field.test.js` to ensure the fix is robust

## Verification Results

### SQL Verification
We manually tested the fix with SQL operations:

1. Confirmed the column exists in the database:
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'clients' 
  AND column_name = 'legal_name';
```

2. Created a new client with legal name:
```sql
INSERT INTO clients (user_id, name, legal_name, contact_name, contact_email, active, created_at) 
VALUES (1, 'Test Legal Name Client', 'Legal Entity Name, Inc.', 'Test Contact', 'test@example.com', true, NOW()) 
RETURNING id, name, legal_name;
```

3. Updated an existing client's legal name:
```sql
UPDATE clients 
SET legal_name = 'Updated Legal Entity Name, LLC', updated_at = NOW() 
WHERE id = 141 
RETURNING id, name, legal_name;
```

All operations worked correctly, confirming the fix is working as expected.

## Impact
This fix ensures that:
1. Clients' legal name information is properly saved in the database
2. Entity fallback logic that relies on legal name works correctly
3. No data is lost between form submissions and database storage

## Additional Considerations
- The fix is backward-compatible with existing clients (null legal_name is acceptable)
- No UI changes were needed as the forms were already correctly implemented
- All storage implementations (database and in-memory) now handle the field consistently
