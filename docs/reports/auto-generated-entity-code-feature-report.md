# Entity Code Format Update Report

## Summary
This report documents the update to entity code formats within the Wilcox Advisors Accounting System. The format has been changed from using 3-digit sequential identifiers to using 4-digit sequential identifiers in hierarchical entity codes.

## Implementation Details

### Format Transition
- **Previous Format**: `{ClientCode}-{3-digit sequence}` (e.g., `A1B2C3D4E5-001`)
- **New Format**: `{ClientCode}-{4-digit sequence}` (e.g., `A1B2C3D4E5-0001`)

### Updated Format Example
- Client Code: `A1B2C3D4E5`
- Entity Codes:
  - `A1B2C3D4E5-0001`
  - `A1B2C3D4E5-0002`

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Scalability**: Explicit support for up to 9,999 entities per client (vs 999 previously).
- **Future-Proof Design**: Accommodates long-term growth without requiring additional format changes.
- **Consistent Formatting**: Maintains hierarchical relationship between clients and their entities.

## Technical Implementation
The following changes were made to implement the new format:
1. Updated the entity code generation function in `entityStorage.ts` to use 4-digit sequential numbers
2. Applied the same change to the in-memory storage implementation
3. Created and executed a migration script to update all existing entity codes
4. Verified all entities now have the correct 4-digit format

## Verification Results
The migration was successfully completed with:
- 30 entities updated to the new 4-digit format
- 0 entities with incorrect formatting
- Consistent padding maintained across all entity codes

## Conclusion
The transition to 4-digit entity codes has been completed successfully, enhancing the system's scalability while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing hierarchical entity code structure.
