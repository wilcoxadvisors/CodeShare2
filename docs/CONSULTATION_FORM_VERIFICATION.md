| Admin email notification verified and received | ✅     |

### Verification Details
- **Current Status**: The consultation form is working correctly
- **Form Submission**: Successfully tested form submission with test data on 2025-04-06
- **Database Verification**: Confirmed submission data is correctly saved to the `consultation_submissions` table
- **Email Notification**: Confirmed email notification is sent to admin email (`garrettwilcox40@gmail.com`)

### Code Examination
The server-side code in `server/formRoutes.ts` is correctly using the proper storage namespace pattern:

```javascript
// Store the submission
let result;
try {
  console.log("Storing consultation in database...");
  result = await storage.forms.createConsultationSubmission(submission);
  console.log("Database storage result:", result);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Database storage error:", error);
  throw error;
}
```

### Database Verification

The latest consultation submission was confirmed in the database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM consultation_submissions ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC LIMIT 1;
```

```
id,companyName,industry,companySize,annualRevenue,services,firstName,lastName,email,phone,preferredContact,message,ipAddress,userAgent,status,createdAt,updatedAt

```

### Conclusion
The consultation form submission process is working correctly end-to-end. No fixes were required as the code was already properly implemented with the correct storage namespace pattern.
