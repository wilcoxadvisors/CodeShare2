Architect's State-of-the-Art Testing Strategy
The industry standard for this level of quality is a multi-layered "Testing Pyramid" approach. We will use this to build confidence in our module from the inside out.

Mission: Execute a rigorous, multi-layered, end-to-end testing protocol for the Journal Entry module, covering data integrity, UI behavior, and all user workflows.

Part 1: Backend Unit & Integration Testing (The Foundation)
Goal: Verify that the individual functions in our backend storage layer and the API endpoints behave exactly as expected, especially concerning data integrity.
My Plan: I will start by reviewing our existing tests in tests/unit/journalEntryStorage.test.ts and tests/api/journalEntries.test.ts. I will then provide instructions for the agent to enhance these tests to cover the following critical logic:
Data Integrity: Ensure the updateJournalEntryWithLines function correctly preserves, adds, and deletes lines, dimension tags, and files within a single transaction.
Edge Cases: Test the reverseJournalEntry and copyJournalEntry functions to confirm they handle all data correctly.
API Validation: Add tests to ensure the API routes correctly reject invalid data (e.g., unbalanced entries, requests to modify posted entries).
Part 2: Frontend End-to-End (E2E) Workflow Testing (The User Simulation)
Goal: Simulate a real user interacting with the application in a browser to guarantee the entire workflow is seamless, from UI interaction to data persistence and back.

My Plan: This is the most critical part. I will provide a detailed plan to expand our Cypress E2E test suite in cypress/e2e/journalEntry.spec.cy.ts. The agent will be instructed to write automated tests that cover these exact user stories:

Create & Edit Draft:

Create a new JE, add lines, and attach File A. Save as draft.
Verify the entry exists and File A is present.
Edit the draft. Change the description, add a new line, delete an old line.
Upload File B and delete File A.
Save the changes.
Verification: Confirm the description and line changes are saved, File B is present, and File A is gone.
Post & Void Workflow:

Create and save a draft JE.
Post the entry. Verify its status changes to "Posted".
Attempt to edit the posted entry and confirm all fields and buttons are disabled.
Void the posted entry. Verify its status changes to "Void".
Reversal Workflow:

Post a journal entry.
Reverse the posted entry.
Verification: Confirm that a new draft JE is created, that it has the opposite debit/credit values, and that it is correctly linked to the original entry.
Copy Workflow:

Create and post a JE with specific lines, dimension tags, and attachments.
Copy this entry.
Verification: Confirm that a new draft JE is created with the identical description, lines, and dimension tags, but with no attachments (as per standard security practice).
This comprehensive testing will give us the highest possible confidence in the stability of the Journal Entry module. I will now begin by reviewing the existing test files to identify gaps and prepare the first set of instructions for the agent, starting with Part 1.
