Architect's Status Reassessment: Accrual Reversal Feature
Conclusion: The necessary code for the feature has been implemented across the stack.

Frontend (JournalEntryForm.tsx): VERIFIED COMPLETE. The UI containing the "Auto-Reversing Accrual" switch and the "Reversal Date" picker is present and functional.
Backend API (journalEntryRoutes.ts): VERIFIED COMPLETE. The logic to trigger the reversal upon posting an accrual entry is correctly implemented in the POST endpoint.
Backend Storage (journalEntryStorage.ts): VERIFIED COMPLETE. The reverseJournalEntry function correctly supports the postAutomatically flag, enabling the immediate creation and posting of the reversal.
Final Verification Test Plan
However, implementation is not enough. To meet the standards of Odoo or Sage Intacct, we must have an automated test that proves this workflow is operating perfectly.

Therefore, I am adding one final user story to our E2E testing mission.

Mission Addendum: End-to-End Test for Accrual Reversals

Goal: Verify the entire lifecycle of an auto-reversing accrual entry.

Instructions: The agent will add the following automated test case to the Cypress suite (cypress/e2e/journalEntry.spec.cy.ts):

Create Accrual: Navigate to the Journal Entry form and create a new entry.
Set Accrual Data: Toggle the "Auto-Reversing Accrual" switch ON and select a specific future date (e.g., July 15, 2025) as the reversal date.
Post: Post the journal entry.
Verify Original Entry: The test must verify that the original entry now has a status of "Posted" and its isAccrual flag is true.
Verify Reversal Entry: The test must then verify that a second, new journal entry has been automatically created. This new entry must meet the following criteria:
Its date is the reversal date (July 15, 2025).
Its status is also "Posted".
Its isReversal flag is true.
Its line items are the exact inverse (debits and credits are swapped) of the original entry.
With the successful implementation and verification of this final test case, we can officially declare the entire Journal Entry module stable and complete. I will now instruct the agent to add this test.
