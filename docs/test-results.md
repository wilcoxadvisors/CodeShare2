| Invalid Parent Code | ⚠️ FAIL | System accepted invalid parent code reference |

### Performance Testing

| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Large Import (100+ accounts) | ⚠️ NOT TESTED | Need to create large test dataset |
| Concurrent Import Operations | ⚠️ NOT TESTED | Need to implement concurrent testing |

## Field Mapping Verification

The following field mappings were verified in both import and export operations:

| Database Field | Import/Export Field | Status |
|----------------|---------------------|--------|
| accountCode    | AccountCode         | ✅ VERIFIED |
| name           | Name                | ✅ VERIFIED |
| type           | Type                | ✅ VERIFIED |
| subtype        | Subtype             | ✅ VERIFIED |
| isSubledger    | IsSubledger         | ✅ VERIFIED |
| subledgerType  | SubledgerType       | ✅ VERIFIED |
| active         | Active              | ✅ VERIFIED |
| description    | Description         | ✅ VERIFIED |
| parentCode     | ParentCode          | ✅ VERIFIED |

## Session Handling

| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Session Maintenance | ✅ PASS | Session properly maintained across API calls |
| Authentication Persistence | ✅ PASS | Auth state correctly preserved in direct testing |

## Root Cause Analysis

The following root causes were identified for the issues encountered:

1. **Inconsistent Update Behavior**: The account update logic in `accountStorage.ts` has conditional code that prevents certain accounts from being updated under specific conditions. This logic needs review.

2. **Incomplete Parent Validation**: The parent validation code doesn't properly check for the existence of parent accounts before proceeding with the import.

3. **Field Case Sensitivity**: Some issues may be related to case sensitivity in field names between the frontend and backend.

4. **Authentication Handling**: The original 401 errors were due to inconsistent implementation of authentication middleware.

## Recommendations

Based on the test results, the following improvements are recommended:

1. **Fix Update Logic**: Review and correct the account update logic to ensure consistent behavior across all account types.

2. **Enhance Parent Validation**: Implement proper checking of parent account existence before import.

3. **Improve Error Reporting**: Provide more detailed error messages that clearly indicate what field or constraint caused the failure.

4. **Add Frontend Validation**: Implement client-side validation to catch common issues before submission.

5. **Expand Test Coverage**: Create additional test cases for edge scenarios like special characters, extreme values, and large datasets.

## Conclusion

The Chart of Accounts import/export functionality is substantially improved and working for most use cases. The export functionality is fully operational with correct field naming. The import functionality works well for adding new accounts but has some inconsistencies when updating existing accounts.

Further work is needed to address the specific issues with account updates and parent validation, but the system is usable in its current state with awareness of these limitations.
