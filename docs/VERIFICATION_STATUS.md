# Verification Status Report

## Final Entity State Verification Results

| Test Case          | Expected Result                         | Actual Result                        | Status |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------|
| Active Entity      | active: true, deletedAt: null           | active: true, deletedAt: null        | ✅ Pass |

| Soft-Deleted Entity| active: false, deletedAt: timestamp     | active: false, deletedAt: timestamp  | ✅ Pass |
| Restored Entity    | active: true, deletedAt: null           | active: true, deletedAt: null        | ✅ Pass |

## API Endpoint Verification

All entity state management API endpoints are functioning correctly:

| API Endpoint                       | Function                   | Status |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------|
| POST /api/entities/{id}/set-inactive | Set entity to inactive     | ✅ Pass |
| DELETE /api/entities/{id}          | Soft-delete entity         | ✅ Pass |
| POST /api/entities/{id}/restore    | Restore entity             | ✅ Pass |
| GET /api/entities/{id}?includeDeleted=true | Get soft-deleted entity | ✅ Pass |

## UI Component Verification

Frontend UI components have been implemented and tested for entity state management:

| UI Component       | Feature                                | Status |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|--------|
| EntityEditModal   | Set Inactive button with confirmation | ✅ Pass |
| EntityEditModal   | Delete button with confirmation       | ✅ Pass |
| EntityEditModal   | Restore button with confirmation      | ✅ Pass |
| EntityEditModal   | Disabled form for deleted entities    | ✅ Pass |
| ClientEditModal   | Entity status badge with state indication | ✅ Pass |
| ClientEditModal   | Context-aware action buttons          | ✅ Pass |
| ClientEditModal   | Confirmation dialogs for all actions  | ✅ Pass |

## Entity State Management Implementation

The system correctly implements the distinction between:

1. **Active entities**: Entities with `active: true` and `deletedAt: null`
   - These are visible in all standard queries
   - Fully operational, no restrictions
   - Appears with "Active" badge in UI

2. **Inactive entities**: Entities with `active: false` and `deletedAt: null`
   - These are still visible in standard queries
   - UI indicators showing they're inactive (grayed-out appearance)
   - "Inactive" badge displayed in entity listings
   - Cannot be set to inactive again (Set Inactive button disabled)

3. **Soft-deleted entities**: Entities with `active: false` and `deletedAt: <timestamp>`
   - These are NOT visible in standard queries (filtered out)
   - Only retrievable with explicit `includeDeleted=true` parameter
   - Can be restored using the restore API endpoint
   - "Deleted" badge displayed in entity listings
   - Form fields disabled when viewing deleted entities
   - Only Restore button available for deleted entities

## Implementation Details

The entity state management is implemented across multiple components:

1. **Database Schema**: Includes both `active` boolean and `deletedAt` timestamp columns

2. **Storage Layer**:
   - `entityStorage.ts` implements proper filtering for both inactive and deleted entities
   - Dedicated methods for state transitions: `setEntityInactive()`, `setEntityActive()`, `deleteEntity()`, and `restoreEntity()`
   - Query methods support parameter flags to include/exclude inactive and deleted entities

3. **API Layer**:
   - Routes for all state management operations
   - Consistent response format with state indicators
   - Proper error handling for not-found and already-deleted entities

4. **UI Layer**:
   - `EntityEditModal.tsx` with state-specific controls
   - `ClientEditModal.tsx` with entity list showing status indicators
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
   - Visual indicators of entity state (badges, styling)
   - State-appropriate action buttons

5. **Test Coverage**:
   - Comprehensive tests for all state transitions
   - Verification of filtering behavior
   - Tests for API endpoints and responses
   - Manual verification of UI components

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Implement UI components for state management (inactive toggles, delete/restore buttons)
- [x] Add confirmation dialogs for sensitive operations
- [x] Improve visibility of entity state in listings and detail views
- [x] Create documentation on entity state management

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add bulk operations for state management
- [ ] Implement entity activity log tracking state changes
- [ ] Add user permissions for state-changing operations
- [ ] Enhance filtering options in entity lists by state
