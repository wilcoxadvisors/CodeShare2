```

| DrawerTrigger     | DOM nesting warning (`<button>` inside `<button>`) | Added `asChild` prop to DrawerTrigger           | ✅ Fixed |

### Implementation Details

The scheduled client cleanup is implemented across multiple components:

1. **Task Configuration**:
   - 90-day threshold defined in `DELETION_THRESHOLD_DAYS` constant
   - System user ID for automated actions: `SYSTEM_USER_ID = 0`

2. **Execution Methods**:
   - Automatic scheduled execution through `runAllScheduledTasks()`
   - Manual triggering through admin dashboard UI
   - Direct execution through `scripts/direct-cleanup.js`

3. **Storage Implementation**:
   - `clientStorage.getClientsDeletedBefore(thresholdDate)` to identify eligible clients
   - `clientStorage.permanentlyDeleteClient(id, adminId)` for safe permanent deletion

4. **API Implementation**:
   - POST `/api/admin/trigger-cleanup` endpoint for manual triggering
   - Admin authentication required for manual triggering
   - Structured response with counts and errors

5. **UI Implementation**:
   - System Maintenance tab in Admin Dashboard
   - Clear information about the cleanup process
   - Confirmation dialog with warnings
   - Success/error toast notifications

## Entity State Management Verification

The system correctly implements the distinction between:

1. **Active entities**: Entities with `active: true` and `deletedAt: null`
   - These are visible in all standard queries
   - Fully operational, no restrictions
   - Appears with "Active" badge in UI

2. **Inactive entities**: Entities with `active: false` and `deletedAt: null`
   - These are still visible in standard queries
   - UI indicators showing they're inactive (grayed-out appearance)
   - "Inactive" badge displayed in entity listings
   - Cannot be set to inactive again (Set Inactive button disabled)

3. **Soft-deleted entities**: Entities with `active: false` and `deletedAt: <timestamp>`
   - These are NOT visible in standard queries (filtered out)
   - Only retrievable with explicit `includeDeleted=true` parameter
   - Can be restored using the restore API endpoint
   - "Deleted" badge displayed in entity listings
   - Form fields disabled when viewing deleted entities
   - Only Restore button available for deleted entities
