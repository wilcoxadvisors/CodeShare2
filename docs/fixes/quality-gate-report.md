### Test Suite Status
- ⚠️ Jest tests timeout despite configuration changes

## Root Cause Analysis
The primary issue with upload failures was due to manually specifying a 'Content-Type' header in axios requests when using FormData. This prevented the browser from automatically setting the correct multipart boundary parameter, resulting in malformed requests.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Close Bug #7 as fixed
2. Begin Dimensions implementation (Task B.2.1) as documented in updated Instructions.md
3. Address test environment stability in a separate task
