# AI-Driven Blog Integration Planning

This document outlines the plan for integrating AI-powered blog content generation into the existing blog management system.

## 1. Database Connectivity

### PostgreSQL Schema Integration

The Python/Flask service will connect to the existing PostgreSQL database using the following approach:

- **Connection Method**: The Python service will use SQLAlchemy ORM to connect to the PostgreSQL database
- **Environment Variables**: Will utilize the same DATABASE_URL from the main application
- **Schema Access**: Will access the blog_posts table to read existing posts and write new AI-generated drafts
- **Database Models**:
  - Will create Python models that mirror the existing Drizzle schema
  - Will maintain consistency with existing column definitions

### Required Dependencies
- `psycopg2-binary` or `pg8000` for PostgreSQL connectivity
- `SQLAlchemy` for ORM functionality
- `alembic` for any necessary migrations

## 2. External News Integration

### Financial News APIs

The following APIs will be integrated for sourcing financial and accounting news:

| API Source | Purpose | Data Format | Update Frequency |
|------------|---------|-------------|------------------|
| Alpha Vantage | Financial news | JSON | Daily |
| Financial Times | Industry articles | RSS/JSON | Daily |
| SEC EDGAR | Regulatory filings | XML/JSON | As available |

### Implementation Details
- API keys will be stored as environment variables
- Rate limiting will be respected with exponential backoff
- Content will be cached to prevent duplicate processing
- Error handling for API outages will ensure system resilience

## 3. AI Drafting Schedule

### Task Scheduler Configuration

| Task | Frequency | Timing | Description |
|------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| News fetching | Daily | 6:00 AM EST | Retrieve latest financial news |
| Content generation | Daily | 7:00 AM EST | Process news and generate drafts |
| Topic research | Weekly | Monday 8:00 AM EST | Generate trending topics for the week |
| Performance analysis | Weekly | Friday 4:00 PM EST | Analyze post performance metrics |

### Implementation
- Flask application will use APScheduler for task scheduling
- Jobs will be persistent and resumable after service restarts
- Logs will track execution history and success/failure metrics
- Email notifications will alert admins of any failures

## 4. Draft Review Workflow

### Process Flow

1. **Generation**: AI creates draft content with metadata (category, tags, etc.)
2. **Marking**: Drafts are stored with `status: "ai_draft"` in the database
3. **Notification**: Admin users receive notification of new drafts
4. **Review Interface**: New drafts appear in Admin Dashboard with clear "AI Generated" indicator
5. **Editing**: Admin can edit, approve, or reject drafts
6. **Publishing**: Approved drafts can be published directly or scheduled

### UI Enhancements Needed
- Add "AI Generated" filter in BlogContentManager
- Create visual indicator for AI-generated content
- Add quality rating system for admins to rate AI content
- Implement feedback mechanism to improve AI generation

## 5. Technology Stack

### AI Technologies
- **Language Model**: OpenAI API (GPT-4) for content generation
- **Embeddings**: Vector database to store topic relationships and content themes
- **Analytics**: Integration with existing blog analytics to optimize content strategy

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Memory requirements: Minimum 2GB RAM for Python service
- Storage: Additional ~500MB for model caching
- API rate limits consideration for external services

## 6. Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Timeframe | Deliverables |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Database connectivity | Week 1 | Python service with DB access |
| News API integration | Week 1-2 | Functional news fetching service |
| AI content generation | Week 2-3 | Basic draft generation functionality |
| Admin UI updates | Week 3 | UI changes for draft management |
| Testing & refinement | Week 4 | System testing and optimization |

## 7. Success Metrics

- **Content Quality**: Admin approval rate of AI-generated drafts
- **Efficiency**: Time saved vs. manual content creation
- **Engagement**: User engagement with AI vs. human content
- **Consistency**: Regularity of content publication

## Next Steps

1. Set up Python service environment and dependencies
2. Implement database connectivity and model sync
3. Create API integrations for news sources
4. Develop AI prompt engineering for quality content
5. Implement draft management in admin UI
