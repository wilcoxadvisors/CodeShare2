# Verification Status Report

## Phase 2 & Phase 3 (Tasks B.1 & B.2) Verification

### Phase 2: Client & Entity Setup
- Client Setup: **Pending verification**
- Entity Setup: **Pending verification**

### Phase 3 - Task B.1: Chart of Accounts
- Account creation: **Pending verification**
- Account retrieval: **Pending verification**
- Account hierarchy: **Pending verification**
- Import/export: **Pending verification**

### Phase 3 - Task B.2: Journal Entries
- Journal entry creation: **Pending verification**
- Journal entry validation: **Pending verification**
- Batch upload: **Pending verification**
- Reports: **Pending verification**

## Verification Process
- A comprehensive verification script has been created at `verification-scripts/comprehensive-verification-p2-p3.js`
- This script will verify all critical functionality and generate a detailed report
- To run the verification, use:
  ```
  cd verification-scripts
  npm install
  node comprehensive-verification-p2-p3.js
  ```

## Automation Status
The verification script will perform the following automated tests:
1. Client creation, retrieval, and updates
2. Entity creation, retrieval, and updates
3. Chart of Accounts creation and structure
4. Journal entry creation with balance validation
5. Batch upload testing
6. Database schema consistency checks

## Manual Verification Steps
Some aspects still require manual verification:
1. UI responsiveness and design consistency
2. User experience flow
3. Edge case handling
4. Large dataset performance

## Prerequisites for Verification
- Server must be running (`npm run dev`)
- Admin user must exist with username `admin` and password `password123`
- Database must be accessible

## Expected Outputs
Upon successful verification, the script will generate:
- A verification report (in `verification-logs/`)
- A template for large dataset upload
- Documentation for batch operations

_This document will be updated with test results once verification is performed._
