# Industry Value Fix Tests

This directory contains test scripts used to diagnose and verify fixes for industry value handling in entity creation and update operations.

## Key Test Files

- **test-industry-direct-db-check.cjs** - Checks the database schema and verifies existing industry values
- **test-industry-numeric-fix.cjs** - Uses direct SQL approach to correctly save industry values
- **test-entity-update.js** - Tests entity update functionality
- **test-entity-creation.cjs** - Tests entity creation with industry values

## Problem Description

The system was experiencing an issue where industry values were being saved incorrectly or as "undefined" in the database. These test scripts helped identify and verify the solution, which involved bypassing the ORM layer and using direct SQL queries for reliable industry value handling.

## Test Results

- The database schema correctly defines the industry column as text and nullable
- Direct SQL insertion approach successfully saves industry values
- The fix implemented in DatabaseStorage.createEntity correctly handles industry values using SQL queries

## Running Tests

To run a test file:

```bash
node tests/industry-fix/test-industry-direct-db-check.cjs
```

## Solution Implemented

The solution involved modifying the `createEntity` method in `server/storage.ts` to use a direct SQL approach that:

1. Explicitly processes industry values for consistency
2. Uses parameterized SQL queries to ensure correct type handling
3. Verifies the saved industry values match the expected values
