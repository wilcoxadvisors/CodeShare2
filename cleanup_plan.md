# Project Cleanup and Organization Plan

## 1. Root Directory Cleanup
Files to move to organized folders:

  - verify-api-endpoints-fixed.js
  - verify-api-endpoints.js
  - import-test.js
  - login-and-test.js
  - fix-tree-response.js
  
- Login utilities to `utils` folder:
  - login.cjs
  - login_script.js

- Temporary files to remove:
  - cookies.txt (non-critical)
  - generated-icon.png (large file not needed for core functionality)

## 2. Attached Assets Cleanup
- Archive old text files from `attached_assets/archive`
- Keep only the latest task instructions in `attached_assets/task-instructions`
- Keep all necessary verification steps files

## 3. Documentation Organization
- Keep important documentation files:
  - Instructions.md
  - Verification steps documentation (Step 1-5)
  - Add a README.md summarizing project status

## 4. Verification Logs Organization
- Organize verification logs by test type
- Keep client account data for reference

## 5. Script Organization
- Organize test scripts by functionality
- Keep all verification scripts separate from utility scripts

## 6. Final Report Creation
- Create a project status summary document
- Document all verification steps completed
- Provide a verification checklist for future reference
