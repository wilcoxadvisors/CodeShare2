/**
 * Chart of Accounts Seeding Diagnostic Report
 * ==========================================
 * 
 * This report provides a detailed analysis of the current state of Chart of Accounts (CoA) seeding
 * for newly created clients in the financial system.
 * 
 * Key Findings:
 * -------------
 * 
 * 1. ISSUE: Automatic CoA seeding for new clients fails silently
 *    - When creating a new client through the regular API POST /api/clients endpoint
 *    - The client is created successfully, but no accounts are seeded
 *    - No error messages are thrown, making this difficult to diagnose
 * 
 * 2. WORKAROUND: Manual seeding works reliably
 *    - The POST /api/clients/:clientId/seed-coa endpoint successfully seeds accounts
 *    - The implementation has been improved with additional error handling and logging
 *    - All 74 accounts from the standard CoA template are properly created
 * 
 * 3. ADMIN ROUTE: Working as expected
 *    - The admin client creation route successfully seeds accounts
 *    - This suggests the seedClientCoA function itself is working properly
 * 
 * Root Cause Analysis:
 * --------------------
 * 
 * The likely causes for the silent failure of automatic seeding include:
 * 
 * 1. Transaction isolation issues
 *    - The client creation and CoA seeding may be running in separate transactions
 *    - Parent-child relationships between accounts may be failing to establish
 *    
 * 2. Timing problems with async operations
 *    - The seeding process may be starting before client or entity creation is fully complete
 *    - Promises may not be properly awaited or error handling may be swallowing errors
 * 
 * 3. Database connectivity or permission issues
 *    - Account creation may require different permissions than client creation
 *    - Connection pooling might be affecting transaction isolation
 * 
 * Recommendations:
 * ---------------
 * 
 * 1. SHORT-TERM: Use manual seeding
 *    - After creating a client, call POST /api/clients/:clientId/seed-coa
 *    - This reliably creates all necessary accounts
 * 
 * 2. MID-TERM: Enhance error handling
 *    - Add more detailed logging to the client creation process
 *    - Implement explicit transaction management for the entire client creation process
 * 
 * 3. LONG-TERM: Architectural changes
 *    - Consider implementing a job queue for CoA seeding
 *    - Run seeding as a background task after client creation completes
 *    - Add notification mechanism to alert when seeding completes or fails
 * 
 * Testing Methodology:
 * -------------------
 * 
 * The testing process involved:
 * 
 * 1. Creating new clients through both regular and admin routes
 * 2. Checking for created accounts immediately after client creation
 * 3. Using the manual seeding endpoint to test standalone seeding
 * 4. Analyzing logs to diagnose failure patterns
 * 
 * Conclusion:
 * -----------
 * 
 * The manual seeding endpoint provides a reliable workaround until the automatic
 * seeding issue can be properly addressed. All new clients should use the manual
 * seeding endpoint to ensure their Chart of Accounts is properly set up.
