# Agent Instructions: Wilcox Advisors Accounting System (Comprehensive Roadmap)

## 1. Project Overview & Goal

* **Project:** Wilcox Advisors Accounting System
* **High-Level Goal:** Build a best-in-class, scalable SaaS accounting platform, inspired by Odoo's open-source backend logic where applicable.
* **Phased Approach:** Manual First -> API Automation -> AI/ML Enhancements -> Full Automation & ERP Features.
* **Target Audience:** Small, medium, and large businesses [cite: uploaded:Business Plan.docx].
* **Tech Stack:** React (Vite, TypeScript, TanStack Query, Shadcn UI), Node.js (Express, TypeScript), PostgreSQL (Drizzle ORM), Python (for AI/ML).
* **Code Location:** `CodeShare/` folder.
* **Reference Docs:** Business Plan.docx, Outline for Accounting System Integration.docx, Accounting System Implementation Plan.docx, Pricing Sheet.docx.

## 2. Business Model & Long-Term Vision

* **Revenue:** Tiered SaaS subscriptions (Basic/Pro/Enterprise) + Add-ons + Implementation Fees [cite: uploaded:Pricing Sheet.docx, uploaded:Business Plan.docx]. Aggressive growth targets ($10M revenue/2k clients by Year 5) [cite: uploaded:Business Plan.docx].
* **Automation Goal:** Progressively automate accounting and finance processes, moving from manual input to API-driven workflows enhanced by AI/ML [cite: uploaded:Outline for Accounting System Integration.docx, uploaded:gemini 3-27.docx].
* **Data Strategy:** Implement data collection mechanisms to enable selling data and creating valuable reports for investors and economists. Ensure robust anonymization, transparent privacy policies, and explicit user consent are in place. Design the system to maximize data availability for AI/ML and forecasting.
* **ERP Evolution:** The long-term goal is to expand the feature set so the platform can be sold and used as a standalone ERP system directly by client finance teams [cite: uploaded:gemini 3-27.docx].
* **Future-Proofing:** Considerations for Blockchain audits and IoT expense tracking are planned for later phases [cite: uploaded:Outline for Accounting System Integration.docx, uploaded:Business Plan.docx].

## 3. Current Development Status

* **Phase 1 (Stabilization & Migration):** COMPLETE. Database migration (junction table for consolidation groups) is finished. Backend logic updated. Code cleanup done.
* **Phase 2 (Guided Setup Flow):** COMPLETED. The 3-step "Add Client" modal flow (`SetupStepper.tsx` + Cards) accessed via `Dashboard.tsx` is now stable.
    * **Update:** All critical setup flow bugs have been fixed (Checkpoints through `f0cc5d4f`), including state management, navigation, and database persistence issues.
* **Phase 3 (Core Accounting Features):** IN PROGRESS.
    * **Current Update:** Task B.1 (Chart of Accounts) is now **COMPLETE**. This includes implementation of client-specific hierarchical CoA, backend/frontend management, `code` -> `accountCode` refactoring, import/export functionality (CSV/Excel) with fixes for update logic and UI improvements, resolution of display bugs, and successful verification. Schema refactoring was performed to move reporting fields (`fsliBucket`, `internalReportingBucket`, `item`) from `accounts` to `journalEntryLines`. Focus now shifts to implementing Journal Entry functionality (Task B.2).

* **Maintain Structure:** Keep the client-specific accounting design consistent across features.
* **Test Thoroughly:** Ensure all functionality works with the new combined client-entity context selector.
* **Log When Needed:** Use `console.log("DEBUG Component: Action:", value)` for tracing complex logic.
* **Verify Incrementally:** Test each specific feature thoroughly before moving to the next.
* **Simplify:** Avoid unnecessary complexity. Focus on clean state management.
* **Ask for Clarification:** If unsure, ask before proceeding.
* **Design Considerations:** Prioritize state-of-the-art, innovative, customer-focused, and easy-to-use design in every aspect of the system. Strive for a great design that influences emotions such as trust, and is trendy and fun.
* **Data Strategy:** Implement data collection mechanisms to enable selling data and creating valuable reports for investors and economists. Ensure robust anonymization, transparent privacy policies, and explicit user consent are in place. Design the system to maximize data availability for AI/ML and forecasting.
* **Code Quality:** Write clean, well-organized, and well-documented code to avoid confusion and ensure maintainability.
* **Efficiency:** Prioritize efficient algorithms and data structures for optimal performance.
* **Testing:** Implement comprehensive automated test scripts to ensure functionality and prevent regressions.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error catching and user-friendly error messages for both users and administrators.
* **Documentation:** Maintain great documentation, including clear file and directory organization, so human coders and AI can easily understand the codebase and its functionality.
