# Agent Instructions: Wilcox Advisors Accounting System (Comprehensive Roadmap)

## 1. Project Overview & Goal

* **Project:** Wilcox Advisors Accounting System
* **High-Level Goal:** Build a best-in-class, scalable SaaS accounting platform, inspired by Odoo's open-source backend logic where applicable.
* **Phased Approach:** Manual First -> API Automation -> AI/ML Enhancements -> Full Automation & ERP Features.
* **Target Audience:** Small, medium, and large businesses.
* **Tech Stack:** React (Vite, TypeScript, TanStack Query, Shadcn UI), Node.js (Express, TypeScript), PostgreSQL (Drizzle ORM), Python (for AI/ML).
* **Code Location:** `CodeShare/` folder.
* **Reference Docs:** (Note: Original references were to uploaded files - Business Plan.docx, Outline for Accounting System Integration.docx, etc. These are conceptual references based on past context.)

## 1.1 Onboarding Flow (Explicitly Updated)

The onboarding workflow is simplified to explicitly include only:
* Client Setup
  * Collect: Name, Legal Name, Address, Tax Info, Industry, Contacts
* Default Entity Creation
  * Automatically created after successful Client creation.
  * Uses explicitly the Client's Name and Industry as defaults.

Note:
* Historical Data, Consolidation Group, and Chart of Accounts (CoA) setups are explicitly excluded from onboarding.
* Historical data will be explicitly handled through the Journal Entry batch upload module.

## 1.2 Industry Dropdown Alignment & Consistency

* Maintain industry dropdown lists explicitly from a single source of truth at: `client/src/lib/industryUtils.ts`
* Explicitly ensure ALL components (ClientSetupCard.tsx, EntityManagementCard.tsx, EntityForm.tsx, ClientOnboardingForm.tsx, etc.) import and utilize this centralized source.
* Immediately remove duplicate implementations of utility functions like ensureIndustryValue explicitly from individual components.

## 2. Business Model & Long-Term Vision

* **Revenue:** Tiered SaaS subscriptions (Basic/Pro/Enterprise) + Add-ons + Implementation Fees. Aggressive growth targets ($10M revenue/2k clients by Year 5).
* **Automation Goal:** Progressively automate accounting and finance processes, moving from manual input to API-driven workflows enhanced by AI/ML.
* **Data Strategy:** Implement data collection mechanisms to enable selling data and creating valuable reports for investors and economists. Ensure robust anonymization, transparent privacy policies, and explicit user consent are in place. Design the system to maximize data availability for AI/ML and forecasting.
* **ERP Evolution:** The long-term goal is to expand the feature set so the platform can be sold and used as a standalone ERP system directly by client finance teams.
* **Future-Proofing:** Considerations for Blockchain audits and IoT expense tracking are planned for later phases.

## 3. Current Development Status

* **Phase 1 (Stabilization & Migration):** COMPLETE. Database migration (junction table for consolidation groups) is finished. Backend logic updated. Code cleanup done.
    * **Recent Fix:** ✅ **Fixed server crash during migrations by correcting the conditional check in `add-soft-deletion-and-audit-logs.ts` that was causing premature process termination.**
* **Phase 2 (Guided Setup Flow):** COMPLETED. The 3-step "Add Client" modal flow (`SetupStepper.tsx` + Cards) accessed via `Dashboard.tsx` is now stable.
    * **Update:** All critical setup flow bugs have been fixed (Checkpoints through `f0cc5d4f`), including state management, navigation, and database persistence issues.
* **Phase 3 (Core Accounting Features):** IN PROGRESS.
    * **Current Update:** Task B.1 (Chart of Accounts) is NEARLY COMPLETE. Fixed account update logic to allow name/active/parentId changes with transactions, while correctly blocking accountCode/type changes. Fixed UI to disable restricted fields when editing accounts with transactions. Still need to finalize UI/UX and ensure consistency across multiple entities.
    * **Current Update:** Task B.2 (General Ledger / Journal Entries) is IN PROGRESS. Manual JE workflow now functional with Create, Edit, Post, Void, and Reverse operations working correctly. The current focus is on implementing/fixing the File Attachment functionality for journal entries (#7 - multi-file, drag-drop, list, download, delete). After this is complete, we will verify batch journal entry upload functionality.

## 5. General Guidelines for Agent

* **Prioritize:** Debug and complete JE File Attachment feature (#7), then focus on JE Batch Upload / Testing (Task B.2). After the JE module is stable, proceed with **Task B.3: Accounts Payable Backend Foundation**.
* **Maintain Structure:** Keep the client-specific accounting design consistent. Follow established patterns (e.g., modular storage).
* **Test Thoroughly:** Ensure functionality works. Write/run automated tests (unit, integration, API).
* **Log When Needed:** Use `console.log("DEBUG Component: Action:", value)` for tracing complex logic.
* **Verify Incrementally:** Test each specific feature/fix thoroughly before moving on.
 * **Recommended verification command:** `node verify-storage-modules.js` should be run after each significant backend change.
* **Simplify:** Avoid unnecessary complexity. Focus on clean state management.
* **Ask for Clarification:** If unsure, ask before proceeding.
* **Design Considerations:** Prioritize state-of-the-art, innovative, customer-focused, easy-to-use design. Aim for trust, trendiness, and fun.
* **Data Strategy:** Keep data collection/strategy goals in mind during design.
* **Code Quality:** Write clean, well-organized, documented code. Follow linting/formatting rules.
* **Efficiency:** Prioritize efficient algorithms and data structures.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error catching and user-friendly messages.
* **Documentation:** Maintain clear documentation and code comments.

## 6. Code Quality & Cleanup Strategy

**Automated Linting and Formatting:**
* **Tools:** Use ESLint and Prettier via project configurations (`.eslintrc.js`, `.prettierrc.json`).
* **Agent Action:** Run linting/formatting commands periodically (e.g., `npx eslint . --fix`, `npx prettier . --write`) to fix issues automatically.

**Automated Unused Code/Dependency Detection:**
* **Tools:** Consider using tools like ts-prune or Knip to find unused exports, files, types, and dependencies.
* **Agent Action:** Run these tools periodically. Based on reports, remove identified unused items after reviewing for potential impacts.

**Manual Code Review:**
* **Agent Action:** On completion of major features or key milestones, conduct a code review focused on identifying code smells, duplicated code, and potential refactoring opportunities.

**Performance Profiling:**
* **Tools:** Use browser performance tools for frontend (especially Lighthouse); use Node.js profiling tools for backend.
* **Agent Action:** Identify and address performance bottlenecks, focusing on critical paths first.

**Documentation Quality:**
* **Agent Action:** Ensure comprehensive technical (code) and user documentation is created and maintained, with a focus on clarity and completeness.

**Regression Testing:**
* **Agent Action:** Implement a robust suite of automated tests for each critical system component, ensuring new changes don't break existing functionality.

**Specific Focus Areas:**
* **Storage Logic:** Further decompose remaining monolithic pieces.
* **API Layer:** Continue enhancing route organization and documentation.
* **Frontend State Management:** Identify and clean up redundant state.
* **TypeScript Type Safety:** Enhance type coverage, especially for API boundary interfaces.

## 7. Continuous Refactoring & Code Quality Requirements

Throughout every task explicitly:
* Refactor continuously from monolithic to modular/microservice architecture:
  * Clearly ensure each module handles single, explicit responsibilities.
  * Immediately extract logic from large files/functions into smaller, maintainable, explicitly named modules and services.
* Proactively search for and remove explicitly:
  * Duplicate implementations, particularly resulting from refactoring.
  * Outdated or unused code, especially from old testing, agent mistakes, or deprecated implementations.
  * Run tools like ts-prune or Knip periodically to clearly detect unused or outdated code explicitly:
    ```bash
    npx ts-prune
    npx knip
    ```
  * Explicitly review results and safely remove verified unnecessary code.

## 8. Immediate Verification Checklist (Explicitly Required)

* Onboarding explicitly matches simplified flow:
  * Client → Automatic Default Entity creation
* Industry dropdown lists explicitly aligned and consistent everywhere.
* Task B.1 import/export functionality explicitly fixed post-refactoring.
* Continuous refactoring explicitly evident in PRs/code changes.
* All new and existing modules clearly documented explicitly.
* Regular execution of unused code detection scripts (ts-prune, knip).
