Fixed both upload and delete mutations to only invalidate specific 'journalEntryAttachments' queries with exact matching, preventing parent journal entry queries from refetching and resetting form data. File operations now preserve user input during upload/delete actions ensuring stable form workflow
- June 16, 2025. **Chart of Accounts Client-Level Refactor Complete** - Successfully refactored Chart of Accounts from entity-based to client-based architecture. Systematically replaced all `currentEntity` references with `selectedClientId`, updated API endpoints to use `/api/clients/{clientId}/accounts` structure, and fixed all mutations to work at client level. Chart of Accounts now operates independently of entity selection, improving user experience and system architecture consistency
- June 16, 2025. **Definitive Three-Part Architecture Fix Complete** - Implemented architect's comprehensive solution: Part 1 finalized URL-based state management with GlobalContextSelector using useNavigate and pages deriving data from useParams; Part 2 replaced updateJournalEntryWithLines with transaction-wrapped, non-destructive backend logic that preserves file attachments; Part 3 fixed frontend cache invalidation using consistent URL-based query keys with exact matching to prevent form resets. System now has stable client/entity switching, proper dimension tag persistence, and immediate UI updates without data loss
- June 16, 2025. **Final Attachment Workflow Bug Cascade Fix Complete** - Executed three-part mission to make attachment module production-ready: Part 1 fixed Edit button navigation to use URL parameters directly instead of context-derived values ensuring proper hierarchical URLs; Part 2 verified attachment data flow in JournalEntryForm with correct props (attachments, status, isInEditMode); Part 3 implemented two-part cache invalidation for both upload and delete mutations to update both attachment list and main journal entry, preventing stale data issues while maintaining form stability
- June 16, 2025. **Three Critical State Management Issues Resolved** - Systematically fixed Chart of Accounts data loading failures, journal entries selector constant switching, and dimensions loading failures on client changes. Updated all queries to TanStack Query v5 syntax, implemented stabilized navigation in GlobalContextSelector with duplicate selection prevention and debounced URL synchronization, added comprehensive query invalidation in EntityContext for client-dependent data refresh, and resolved all TypeScript compilation errors for production-ready stability
- June 17, 2025. **Critical Documentation Inconsistencies Fixed** - Resolved conflicting status reports throughout Instructions.md that were causing confusion about project priorities. Corrected Dimensions module status from "COMPLETE" to accurate "IN PROGRESS" reflecting backend foundation complete but missing critical UI features.

Added comprehensive Journal Entry Editing Workflow Definitive Fix Plan with three-part mission tracking for systematic resolution of data persistence and UI update issues
- June 17, 2025. **File Attachment Bug #7 Complete Resolution** - Systematically resolved critical file attachment functionality through comprehensive three-part repair: Part 1 fixed all TypeScript errors in backend attachment routes by adding proper return statements after throwNotFound and throwForbidden calls; Part 2 corrected data flow by implementing proper useJournalEntryFiles hook in AttachmentSection instead of relying on inconsistent existingEntry?.files prop data; Part 3 updated all attachment references throughout component to use actualAttachments from query for consistent data structure. File attachment system now has proper backend route validation, consistent frontend data fetching, and reliable attachment display/management functionality
- June 17, 2025. **Critical updateJournalEntryWithLines Architectural Overhaul Complete** - Completely refactored the journal entry update system from destructive "delete and recreate" approach to intelligent selective updates. Replaced wholesale line deletion with smart comparison logic that only updates changed lines, inserts new lines, and removes truly deleted lines. Added dedicated updateLineDimensionTags helper method for proper dimension tag management. Implementation preserves file attachments, maintains data integrity, prevents race conditions, and improves performance by processing only changed data. All operations wrapped in atomic database transactions ensuring consistency
- June 17, 2025. **Critical Routing and EntityContext Architectural Fix Complete** - Resolved 404 navigation errors and broken state management by implementing two-part solution: Part 1 added missing client-specific routes (/clients/:clientId/chart-of-accounts and /clients/:clientId/manage/dimensions) to App.tsx router configuration; Part 2 made EntityContext fully URL-reactive with dedicated useEffect that synchronizes selectedClientId from URL parameters, enforcing URL as single source of truth. Fixed GlobalContextSelector displaying "Select client" incorrectly and Dimensions module receiving no clientId. EntityContext now passively listens to URL changes and maintains proper state synchronization
- June 17, 2025. **Final EntityContext State Management Architecture Complete** - Implemented definitive three-part architectural fix to resolve EntityContext provider scope issues: Part 1 removed broken URL synchronization logic from EntityContext that used useParams outside router scope; Part 2 created dedicated EntityUrlSync component within router scope to handle URL-to-context synchronization; Part 3 placed synchronization component in AppLayout to ensure proper URL parameter access. Fixed GlobalContextSelector client-level page detection to properly handle both Chart of Accounts and Dimensions modules. System now has clean separation between URL-driven state and context state with proper architectural boundaries
- June 17, 2025. **Definitive EntityContext Race Condition Elimination Complete** - Executed architect's three-part final solution to eliminate all state synchronization race conditions: Part 1 fortified EntityContext with localStorage-based state initialization, reliable setters with automatic persistence, and full object exposure via useMemo; Part 2 corrected EntityUrlSync to use new setter functions that work with full client/entity objects; Part 3 simplified GlobalContextSelector display logic with direct context value derivation. Context now initializes immediately from localStorage, eliminating UI flicker and ensuring reliable state persistence across page refreshes
- June 17, 2025. **Client-Only Pages URL Synchronization Complete** - Fixed client switching issues on Chart of Accounts and Dimensions pages by implementing URL-based client ID extraction. Updated GlobalContextSelector to properly display client names for client-only pages using URL parameters instead of EntityContext. Replaced all selectedClientId references with URL-derived clientId in Dimensions page. Both pages now correctly load data and display proper client information when switching between clients
