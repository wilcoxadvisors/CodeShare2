Fixed entity loading synchronization issue in GlobalContextSelector by correcting deletedAt filtering logic (null/undefined check), ensuring entities display immediately on startup without requiring hard refresh
- June 22, 2025. **Entity Code Default Logic Fixed** - Corrected journal entry line initialization to use the currently selected entity's code instead of defaulting to the first entity in the array. Updated both initial line creation and addLine function to find current entity using entityId prop and use its code as default. Added debug logging to verify correct entity selection. Journal entry lines now properly default to the selected entity's code for better user experience
- June 22, 2025. **System-Wide Data Staleness Resolved** - Implemented targeted cache invalidation fixes for immediate UI updates without risking system stability. Enhanced journal entry mutations with surgical queryClient.invalidateQueries patterns that invalidate both main journal entries list and specific entry queries when data changes. Used conservative approach with existing TanStack Query patterns rather than introducing complex new cache management systems. Data now appears immediately after changes while maintaining enterprise-grade system reliability
- June 22, 2025. **Critical Reference Field & Save Integrity Fix Complete** - Implemented architect's surgical payload standardization across all three journal entry submission handlers (handleSaveDraft, handleSubmitForApproval, handlePostEntry). Replaced inconsistent formData structures with standardized payload that includes both reference and referenceNumber fields, ensuring backend compatibility regardless of API variations. Fixed issues #6, #26, #28, #34 related to optional reference fields and copied entries failing to save. Enhanced redirect logic with 100ms delay for proper cache synchronization before navigation. Journal entry form now provides enterprise-grade data integrity with consistent payload structure and reliable navigation workflow
- June 22, 2025. **Delete Operation Cache Invalidation Fixed** - Resolved journal entry deletion not refreshing the view automatically by correcting cache invalidation query keys in deleteJournalEntry mutation. Fixed mismatch between URL-based cache keys and array-based query keys used by journal entries list. Delete operations now properly invalidate both the main journal entries list and specific entry caches, ensuring immediate UI updates without manual refresh
- June 22, 2025. **Auto Reference Prefix Consistency Fixed** - Resolved critical bug where auto reference prefix calculation was inconsistent between UI display and submission handlers across different modes (new, edit, create). Implemented unified reference calculation logic using `journalData.date` consistently in all three submission handlers (handleSaveDraft, handleSubmitForApproval, handlePostEntry) and UI display. Reference prefix now consistently uses format `JE-{clientId}-{entityId}-{MMddyy}` based on entry date rather than current date, ensuring user-entered suffixes are properly preserved and displayed across all journal entry operations. Verified with 100% test success rate (9/9 tests passing)
