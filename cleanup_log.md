# Test Data Cleanup Log

## Summary
The test data cleanup script was successfully implemented and executed to identify and delete test clients and their associated data while preserving specific test clients (IDs 1, 2, 7).

## Implementation Process
1. Created a comprehensive TypeScript cleanup script (`scripts/cleanup-test-data.ts`)
2. Implemented a structured deletion process respecting foreign key constraints:
   - User entity access records
   - Journal entry files
   - Journal entry lines
   - Journal entries
   - Accounts
   - Locations
   - Budgets and budget-related data
   - Forecasts
   - Fixed Assets
   - Various reporting and activity data
   - Entities
   - Clients

## Issues Encountered and Resolved
1. **Column name discrepancy in forecasts table**: Found a mismatch between schema definition (`entity_id`) and actual database structure (`entityId`). Updated script to use the correct column name.
2. **Journal entries linked to client_id**: Encountered foreign key constraint violation when deleting clients. Added a specific step to delete journal entries directly linked to clients before client deletion.
3. **SQL result handling**: Improved array handling with proper type checking for raw SQL query results.

## Test Execution Results
During test execution, the script successfully:
- Identified 1 test client to delete (ID 130: "Test Client")
- Identified 1 entity to delete (ID 248: "Test Entity")
- Deleted 125 journal entry lines
- Deleted 43 journal entries
- Deleted 12 additional journal entry lines linked to client accounts
- Deleted 2 accounts
- Deleted 1 entity
- Deleted 1 client

## Documentation
- Updated `scripts/README.md` with detailed information about the cleanup script
- Created this cleanup log to document the process and outcomes

## Conclusion
The cleanup script was successfully implemented and tested. It provides a reliable mechanism to maintain database cleanliness by safely removing test data while preserving essential system data.
