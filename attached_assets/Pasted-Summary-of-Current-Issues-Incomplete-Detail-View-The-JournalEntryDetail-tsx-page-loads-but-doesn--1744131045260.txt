Summary of Current Issues:

Incomplete Detail View: The JournalEntryDetail.tsx page loads but doesn't show all necessary header info or line details correctly (specifically showing the wrong account format in the lines).
Edit Action Broken: The 'Edit' button navigates to a 404 page.
Workflow Actions Broken: 'Submit for Approval' (and likely 'Post', 'Approve') buttons are either missing or don't trigger the correct action.
List View Needs Improvement: The main JE list could be more informative (needs booking period, separate debit/credit totals).
Analysis & What to Tell the Agent:

Incomplete Detail Display:

Problem: The agent focused on getting the data but not fully displaying it correctly within JournalEntryDetail.tsx. The console logs show the data (Using journalEntry: Object) and line format (First line format: Server format (type/amount)) are available, but the UI isn't rendering everything. Specifically, the account display in the lines table needs the same fix applied to the dropdown (showing code + name).
Instruction: "Please review the JSX rendering in JournalEntryDetail.tsx.
Ensure all header fields fetched (ID, Date, Description, Status, Reference, Totals etc.) are displayed.
In the lines table, ensure each line correctly displays the Account Code + Name (like the dropdown now does), Entity Code, Line Description, and correctly formatted Debit/Credit amounts (you might need to convert the 'type'/'amount' fields back to debit/credit for display if that's desired)."
Edit Button (404 Error):

Problem: The link associated with the Edit button is incorrect. It should likely go to a dedicated edit route that reuses the JournalEntryForm.
Instruction: "The 'Edit' button on the detail page leads to a 404.
Please ensure the button links to a route like /journal-entries/:id/edit.
Define this route in client/src/App.tsx.
Make this route render the JournalEntryForm component, passing the :id so the form can fetch the existing JE data and pre-fill for editing."
Workflow Actions (Submit for Approval, etc.):

Problem: These core workflow steps are missing or broken.
Instruction: "The workflow buttons ('Submit for Approval', 'Approve', 'Post') are not functional on the detail page.
Please implement these buttons in JournalEntryDetail.tsx, ensuring they appear conditionally based on the JE's current status and user permissions.
Connect these buttons to corresponding functions (likely mutations using TanStack Query, defined in useJournalEntry.ts or the component) that call the backend API endpoints:
POST /api/entities/:entityId/journal-entries/:id/request-approval
POST /api/entities/:entityId/journal-entries/:id/approve
POST /api/entities/:entityId/journal-entries/:id/post
Verify these backend endpoints exist and function correctly in server/journalEntryRoutes.ts."
JE List Page Improvements:

Problem: The main list lacks some useful columns.
Instruction: "Please enhance the JE list page (client/src/features/journal-entries/pages/JournalEntries.tsx):
Add a 'Booking Period' column (Note: This might require adding the field to the JE schema and backend logic).
Replace the single 'Amount' column with separate 'Total Debit' and 'Total Credit' columns."
Alignment with Instructions.md:

Fixing the detail display and workflow actions is essential for completing the Core Accounting Module (Phase B.2).
Improving the UI/UX of both the list and detail pages aligns with the goals of creating an "easy-to-use" and "customer-focused" application.
Implementing the workflow steps moves towards the Automation Goals.
