General Observations
Extensive Test Suite & Folder Structure

You have a lot of test scripts organized by domain (coa-import-export, industry-fix, consolidation, etc.). That’s good for grouping related tests, but there’s some overlap and archived files that can lead to confusion. Consider cleaning up or clearly labeling folders that are truly deprecated vs. still relevant.

It might help to standardize naming conventions (e.g., test-something.js vs. something-test.js) so teammates can quickly identify which files are test files vs. support scripts.

Use of Archives

The archive directories contain older or alternative test scripts. If they’re truly for reference, rename them to deprecated or add a README in each archival folder clarifying why they’re there. If any code is no longer useful, delete it—less is more in large repos.

Lack of a Single Entry-Point Test Runner

Most Node testing setups employ a test framework (Jest, Mocha, Vitest) plus a single command, e.g. npm run test, that discovers and runs all tests.

Right now, your test scripts seem partially ad-hoc. Some use .test.js or .test.ts (suggesting a framework like Jest), while others (like test-entity-update.js) are clearly run as standalone Node scripts.

Having a single npm test command that systematically runs all relevant tests will make your life easier, ensure consistency, and allow test reporters (coverage, summary, pass/fail) to aggregate results.

Manual Axios/Cookie Management

Your approach to interceptors for logging and cookie management is comprehensive but also fairly verbose. For large test suites, you might consider:

Using a library like axios-cookiejar-support or supertest to handle cookies automatically.

Setting up a logger abstraction so you can optionally disable verbose logging (less console clutter in CI).

Too many raw console.log statements can be helpful for debugging but quickly pollute CI logs. You might prefer a logger (e.g., pino or winston) with configurable levels.

Credentials & Environment Configuration

In some scripts (test-entity-update.js), credentials and base URLs are hard-coded (username: 'admin', password: 'password123', baseURL: 'http://localhost:5000').

Consider using environment variables or a config file so you can vary these in different environments (dev, staging, production). This also avoids exposing real credentials in version control.

Verbose Logging in Tests

Many of your test scripts log the entire request/response payload. This is helpful for debugging tricky issues, but you might want to guard those logs behind a debug flag to keep routine test runs from drowning in output.

For example, use DEBUG=test:* node yourTests.js to see logs, otherwise keep them minimal.

Code Duplication Across Tests

Some common logic—like logging in as admin, parsing responses, handling errors—appears repeated in multiple test files.

Factor out repeated steps into a helper module (e.g., authHelpers.js or testUtils.js). That way your tests remain concise, and changes to authentication or logging can be done in one place.

Specific File Critiques
stringUtils.ts
Overall: Well-written, straightforward string utilities with TypeScript definitions and helpful doc comments.

Potential Improvement:

In generateSlug, consider removing leading or trailing hyphens after your replacements, e.g. .replace(/^-+|-+$/g, ''), so you don’t end up with -some-slug- if the original string began/ended with non-alphanumeric characters.

In truncateText, if the text has no spaces and is over maxLength, you cut mid-word. That might be intentional, but you could handle the “no space found” scenario differently if you want a gentler cut or an alternate approach.

test-entity-update.js (from industry-fix)
Strengths:

Clear step-by-step approach with well-labeled console output, so it’s easy to follow the test logic.

Good use of try/catch blocks around the major steps (login, create client, create entity, update entity, verify).

Potential Issues:

This script runs as a standalone Node script. If you’re using Jest or Mocha for other tests, you might unify the approach. It’s fine for one-off debugging, but a single test runner would help keep the codebase consistent.

Hard-coded credentials (username: 'admin', password: 'password123') and base URL (http://localhost:5000) should be replaced with environment-based config to avoid accidentally committing secrets or limiting reusability.

Copious console logging might bury the actual pass/fail outcomes. If you ever want to run these in CI, a testing framework’s reporting might be more standardized.

Overall Recommendations
Adopt or Enforce a Single Testing Framework

If you aren’t already, consider using Jest (or Mocha/Chai) across all test scripts. Convert scripts like test-entity-update.js into standard test files with describe/it blocks. You can still do the same requests/logging, but you’ll gain uniform pass/fail reporting and coverage tools.

Centralize Common Setup

Move shared code (axios instances, login flows, cookie handling) into a dedicated utility file. That cuts repetition and keeps test files focused on the actual scenario they test.

Leverage Environment Variables

For credentials, base URLs, ports, etc. This is particularly useful if you need to run tests on different environments or in Docker containers.

Clean Up or Remove Old Archives

If old test scripts in archive or tmp are no longer relevant, remove them. If they’re still relevant references, add short READMEs clarifying what they do and when they’re needed.

Reduce or Gate Verbose Logging

Introduce a logging or debug library that can be toggled on/off with an environment variable. This helps keep daily test runs tidy but still allows deep debugging when needed.

Consider Linting & Formatting

If you haven’t already, set up an .eslintrc or prettier to maintain consistent coding standards across your test files, utility modules, and TypeScript code.

Final Thoughts
Overall, the code is functional and fairly well-structured, especially given how many tests you have. The biggest improvements will come from consolidation (common modules, single runner) and configurability (env vars, less hard-coded data).

Don’t be afraid to delete truly obsolete files. Less code to maintain means fewer hidden traps.

Once you standardize your test approach, everything else (logging, coverage, debugging) tends to get simpler!
