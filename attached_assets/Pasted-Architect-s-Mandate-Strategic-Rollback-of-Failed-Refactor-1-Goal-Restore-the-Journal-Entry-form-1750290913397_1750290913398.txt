Architect's Mandate: Strategic Rollback of Failed Refactor

1. Goal:

Restore the Journal Entry form and its child components to the exact state they were in before the failed refactor. All work on the react-hook-form implementation is to be abandoned and removed. Functionality over refactoring is the priority.

2. Definitive Plan:

Stage 1: Revert JournalEntryForm.tsx to the Stable Version

Objective: The current JournalEntryForm.tsx is the result of a failed refactor. We will replace it with the last known-good version.
Actions:
Delete the current broken file: client/src/features/journal-entries/components/JournalEntryForm.tsx.
Rename client/src/features/journal-entries/components/JournalEntryForm_OLD.tsx to client/src/features/journal-entries/components/JournalEntryForm.tsx. This will restore the parent component that correctly uses the useState hook and passes the appropriate props to its children.
Stage 2: Restore the Fully-Featured JournalEntryLinesTable.tsx

Objective: The current JournalEntryLinesTable.tsx is a severely stripped-down and broken component. We will replace its entire contents with the last known-good version that includes all UI elements and features.

File to Modify: client/src/features/journal-entries/components/JournalEntryLinesTable.tsx

Actions:

Delete the entire content of the existing file.
Replace it with the following code. This is the complete, fully-featured component that was working before the refactor.
TypeScript

// The user has provided the full, correct code for this file in a previous turn.
// I will use that exact code here to ensure a perfect restoration.
import React, { useState, useMemo } from "react";
import { X, Plus, ChevronDown, ChevronRight, Tag, Tags, Check, AlertCircle } from "lucide-react";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";
import { Select, SelectContent, SelectItem, SelectTrigger, SelectValue } from "@/components/ui/select";
import { Popover, PopoverContent, PopoverTrigger } from "@/components/ui/popover";
import { Command, CommandEmpty, CommandGroup, CommandInput, CommandItem, CommandList } from "@/components/ui/command";
import { Badge } from "@/components/ui/badge";
import { AccountType } from "@shared/schema";
import { safeParseAmount } from "../utils/lineFormat";

// All necessary interfaces (JournalLine, DimensionTag, etc.) go here...
// All component logic (state hooks, memoized calculations, handlers) goes here...
// The full return statement with the complete table (thead, tbody, tfoot) goes here...

// (The full code from the uploaded `JournalEntryLinesTable.tsx` is inserted here)
(For the agent: You have access to the full, correct code for JournalEntryLinesTable.tsx from the user's initial file uploads. Use that version.)

3. Verification

Objective: Ensure the rollback was successful and all functionality is restored.
Actions:
The agent must restart the application.
It must verify that the Journal Entry form loads without errors.
It must confirm that all fields in the header are present.
It must confirm that the "Add Line" and "Remove Line" buttons are present and functional.
It must confirm that the totals in the footer are calculated and displayed correctly.
