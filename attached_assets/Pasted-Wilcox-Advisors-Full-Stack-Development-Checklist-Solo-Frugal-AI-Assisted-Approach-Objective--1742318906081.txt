Wilcox Advisors Full-Stack Development Checklist (Solo, Frugal, AI-Assisted Approach)

Objective:

Develop a comprehensive, scalable, and secure accounting solution with distinct admin, employee, and client dashboards, inspired by Odoo's structure and functionality, using Claude and AI-driven coding assistance to ensure minimal budget expenditure.

Immediate Priorities

Step 1: Admin and Employee Dashboard Development

Design intuitive UI with React, Tailwind CSS, and Material-UI.

Include sections for managing:

General Ledger (GL)

Trial Balance (TB)

Subledgers (AP, AR, Payroll)

Cash flow forecasts

Budget management

Implement role-based access control (JWT/MFA).

Testing: React Testing Library for UI component validation.

Step 2: Client Dashboard Development

User-friendly dashboard for clients to view financial reports, cash flow forecasts, budgets, and subledger details.

File upload functionality (manual entries, journal entry documentation).

Secure login and role-specific views.

Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 standards).

Interactive visualizations using Recharts or similar.

Step 3: Backend Development (Inspired by Odoo)

Use Node.js and Express framework.

Set up MongoDB database inspired by Odoo's modular structure.

Develop CRUD API endpoints (manual entries initially).

Implement JWT authentication and role-based access control.

Integrate XAI API for preliminary AI insights.

Weekly Development Roadmap

Week 1-2: Admin/Employee Dashboard

UI layout & components (navigation, GL, TB, subledgers, file uploads).

Implement basic JWT authentication (login/logout).

Test UI components extensively (React Testing Library).

Week 3-4: Client Dashboard

Dashboard components, file upload implementation.

Security (authentication) and role-based access.

Week 5-6: Backend Functions Development

Setup MongoDB Atlas and backend deployment on Render.

Implement manual journal entry endpoints and file upload parsing.

Start integrating preliminary AI analytics (XAI).

Week 7-8: API Integrations

Plaid (banks), Stripe (payments), and Gusto (payroll).

API testing with Postman or Insomnia.

Week 9+: Advanced UI & Backend Enhancements

Advanced AI integration, security enhancements, scalability improvements.

Explore blockchain and IoT technologies.
