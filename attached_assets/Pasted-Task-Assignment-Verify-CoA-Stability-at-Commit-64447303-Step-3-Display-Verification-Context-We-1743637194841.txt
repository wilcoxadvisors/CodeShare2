Task Assignment: Verify CoA Stability at Commit 64447303 (Step 3: Display Verification)

Context:
We are verifying the stability of the CoA module at commit 64447303. Step 1 (Template & Seeding) passed code review. Step 2 (API Verification) is being skipped as it was recently verified extensively. We now need to verify the frontend display.

Goal:
Verify that the Chart of Accounts UI (ChartOfAccounts.tsx) correctly fetches data via the API and displays it correctly (table, hierarchy) for an existing client at commit 64447303.

Instructions (Step 3 of Verification Plan):

Action: Add Frontend Logging (Optional but Recommended):

Consider adding temporary, clearly labeled console.log statements in client/src/pages/ChartOfAccounts.tsx to help debug if needed:
Log the result of useContext(GlobalContext) for currentEntity.
Log the clientId/entityId being used in the useQuery key for fetching accounts.
Log the complete accountTreeQuery.data (or equivalent query hook result), isLoading, isError, error.
Log the props passed to the <DataTable ... /> component.
Action: Observe UI via Web Tool:

Ensure the application is running (npm run dev).
Use the web application tool to log in as admin (admin/password123).
Simulate navigating to the Chart of Accounts page for an existing client known to have accounts (e.g., Client ID 1 or Client ID 128).
Action: Analyze UI & Logs:

Carefully observe the UI rendered in the web application tool.
Is the Chart of Accounts table populated with data?
Is the hierarchy displayed correctly (e.g., indentation, expand/collapse if applicable at this commit)?
Does the data look correct (e.g., accountCode values visible)?
Check the browser's developer console logs (if accessible via the tool or separate inspection) for any JavaScript errors or warnings related to data fetching or rendering.
Verification:

The Chart of Accounts page loads without crashing or obvious errors.
The account data table is populated correctly for the selected client.
The account hierarchy is rendered appropriately.
No critical errors related to CoA display appear in the browser console.
Reporting:

Report PASS/FAIL for the Display Verification (Step 3).
Provide observations based on the web tool (description of what is displayed). Include a screenshot if possible.
Note any errors observed in the browser console logs.
Await confirmation before proceeding to Step 4 (Add Account Verification).
