Root Cause Analysis
Incomplete Fix by Previous Agent: The agent correctly identified that clientId needed to be passed to the AttachmentSection, but it failed to update the component's function definition to receive that prop. This is why a TypeScript error occurred and the fix didn't work.
Incorrect API Response Handling: The console logs show that after the partial fix, the frontend is now calling the correct API endpoint to get the files (/api/.../files). This is progress. However, the log ARCHITECT_DEBUG_ATTACHMENT_TRANSFORM: Object reveals the next problem: the code is expecting the API to return a simple array of files, but the API is actually wrapping that array inside a JSON object. The frontend code isn't looking inside this object, so it never finds the files.
We will fix both of these issues now.

Mandatory Code Fixes
Fix #1: Correctly Pass and Receive the clientId

This fix ensures the AttachmentSection properly receives the clientId it needs.

File: client/src/features/journal-entries/components/JournalEntryForm.tsx

Action: Locate the AttachmentSection function definition (around line 462). You will replace the entire function signature and the lines that get clientId from context with the corrected version below. This completes the work the previous agent left unfinished.

Replace this code block:

TypeScript

function AttachmentSection({
  entityId,
  journalEntryId,
  pendingFiles,
  setPendingFiles,
  pendingFilesMetadata,
  setPendingFilesMetadata,
  onUploadToEntryRef,
}: AttachmentSectionProps) {
  const { toast } = useToast();
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  const [uploadProgress, setUploadProgress] = useState<number>(0);

  // Get client ID from context
  const { selectedClientId } = useEntity();
  // Convert nullable selectedClientId to number or undefined
  const clientId = typeof selectedClientId === 'number' ? selectedClientId : undefined;
With this corrected code block:

TypeScript

function AttachmentSection({
  entityId,
  clientId, // Now correctly received as a prop
  journalEntryId,
  pendingFiles,
  setPendingFiles,
  pendingFilesMetadata,
  setPendingFilesMetadata,
  onUploadToEntryRef,
}: AttachmentSectionProps) {
  const { toast } = useToast();
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  const [uploadProgress, setUploadProgress] = useState<number>(0);

  // No longer need to get clientId from context here
Fix #2: Correctly Extract Files from the API Response

This new fix addresses the data loading problem revealed in the logs.

File: client/src/features/journal-entries/hooks/attachmentQueries.ts

Action: Locate the useJournalEntryFiles hook. You will modify the line that processes the API response to correctly find the array of files inside the response object.

Find this line (around line 34):

TypeScript

const files = response?.data || [];
Replace it with this corrected line:

TypeScript

const files = response?.data?.files || response?.data || [];
After applying both of these fixes, the AttachmentSection will correctly receive the clientId, the useJournalEntryFiles hook will be enabled, it will successfully make the API call, and it will correctly parse the response to find and display the list of attachments.

Please implement these changes and refresh the edit page. The attachments for the journal entry should now be visible.
