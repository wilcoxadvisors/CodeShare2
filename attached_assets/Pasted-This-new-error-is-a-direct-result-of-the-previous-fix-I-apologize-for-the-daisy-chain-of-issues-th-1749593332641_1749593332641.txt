This new error is a direct result of the previous fix. I apologize for the daisy-chain of issues; this is a classic initialization problem in React components where the order of operations is critical.

Here is the breakdown of the new error and the definitive fix.

Root Cause Analysis
Previous Error: We had an error where onDrop was trying to use entry before entry was declared.
Previous Fix: The agent correctly moved the onDrop function to be after entry is declared.
New Error: ReferenceError: Cannot access 'onDrop' before initialization. This happened because while the onDrop function was moved down, the useDropzone hook that calls onDrop was left behind in its original position, higher up in the file. Now useDropzone is trying to access onDrop before it's declared.
The solution is to ensure the useDropzone hook is also moved down to be declared only after its dependency, onDrop, is available.

Instructions for Replit AI Agent
Hello Agent. The last fix introduced a new, but related, initialization error. Please apply the following correction.

High-Level Goal:

Fix the new ReferenceError: Cannot access 'onDrop' before initialization in the file JournalEntryDetail.tsx.

MANDATORY INSTRUCTIONS: Detailed Code Fix

You will fix this by moving the useDropzone hook so it is declared after the onDrop function it depends on.

File to Modify: client/src/features/journal-entries/pages/JournalEntryDetail.tsx

Action:

Find and cut the entire useDropzone hook definition. It starts with const { getRootProps, ... (around line 528) and looks like this:

TypeScript

// CUT THIS ENTIRE BLOCK
const { getRootProps, getInputProps, isDragActive } = useDropzone({
  onDrop,
  accept: {
    // ... (file types)
  },
  maxSize: 10485760, // 10MB
  multiple: true
});
Find the onDrop function definition that was moved in the previous step (it should be around line 707).

Paste the useDropzone code block you just cut immediately AFTER the closing bracket }); of the onDrop function.

The final, correct order of these related blocks must be:

The useQuery and useMemo that defines entry.
The useCallback that defines onDrop.
The useDropzone hook that uses onDrop.
The return (...) statement containing the JSX.
This will resolve the initialization chain reaction and allow the page to render correctly.
