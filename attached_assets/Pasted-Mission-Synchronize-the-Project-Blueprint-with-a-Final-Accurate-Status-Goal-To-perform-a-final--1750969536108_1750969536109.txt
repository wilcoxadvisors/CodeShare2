Mission: Synchronize the Project Blueprint with a Final, Accurate Status

Goal: To perform a final, surgical update on docs/Instructions.md. This update will:

Mark the "Batch Import" feature as code-complete.

Set the next mission to be the manual, end-to-end verification of the "Smart Import" workflow.

Accurately update the status of the Dimensions module to COMPLETE, while explicitly leaving the "Smart Rules" feature as the next outstanding task in that section.

Architectural Justification: This update will create a perfectly accurate "single source of truth" for the project. It clarifies that all development on the current feature is finished and that we are formally moving into a testing and verification phase, while correctly tracking the status of future planned work.

-   **Status:** Awaiting execution by the Lead Architect and team.
Step 2: Update the "Detailed Development Status" Section

Action: Find the ## 7. Historical Documentation: Detailed Development Status section.

Instruction: Within this section, locate the line for Task B.2.1 (Dimensions & Smart Rules). Replace the entire description for that task with the following, which correctly separates the two features.

Replace this line:
Current Update: Task B.2.1 (Dimensions & Smart Rules): ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS. Backend foundation complete, frontend UI for listing/creating dimensions complete. Next: Build UI to add/edit/deactivate dimension values and integrate tagging into Journal Entry form.

With this new, accurate text:
Current Update: Task B.2.1 (Dimensions & Smart Rules): ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS. The Dimensions module UI is now considered complete. The next major task for this feature set is the implementation of the Smart Rules MVP.

Step 3: Update the "Detailed Task List" Section

Action: Find the ## 8. Historical Documentation: Detailed Task List section.

Instruction: Find the line for (Task B.2.1) Dimensions & Smart Rules. Replace the entire checklist for this task with the following, which marks the Dimensions work as complete and leaves Smart Rules as the next action.

Replace the old checklist:

(Task B.2.1) Dimensions & Smart Rules: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS (Current Focus)
âœ… Create client-level master-data tables...
...
ðŸ”„ NEXT: Build UI to add/edit/deactivate values for each dimension...
With this new, accurate checklist:

(Task B.2.1) Dimensions & Smart Rules: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
âœ… Create client-level master-data tables in `shared/schema.ts`.
âœ… Seed system dimensions: Department, Location, Customer, etc.
âœ… Build backend Storage Layer and API routes for CRUD operations.
âœ… Build frontend UI to list, create, edit, and deactivate dimensions and their values.
âœ… Integrate Dimensions into the Journal Entry form, allowing each line to be tagged.
ðŸ”„ **NEXT:** Implement a Smart Rules MVP (JSON validation).
