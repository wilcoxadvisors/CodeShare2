Architect's Assessment
Analysis of Failures:

The agent's verification script log, despite the agent's summary, clearly tells us what is still broken:

Attachment Preservation on Edit: The "Edit the Draft" step failed. This means our primary bug—that attachments disappear or are not handled correctly during an update—is still not fixed.
Void/Reverse/Copy Operations: The script shows failures in these workflows. The logs suggest this is due to invalid status transitions or incorrect entity validation.
Accrual Reversal: The script did not reach this step, but the agent's summary "requires implementation completion" is an admission that this feature, which I was previously told was complete, is in fact, not.
Conclusion:

The core CRUD and lifecycle of a journal entry is fundamentally broken. We are not moving on to new features. We will achieve a 100% pass rate on the verification script by fixing these critical bugs.

Definitive Rework Plan
Mission: Achieve a 100% pass rate on the run_final_verification.js script by fixing the attachment, void, and accrual/reversal logic.

Instructions for the Agent:

You will now fix the remaining issues in order of priority.

Part 1: Fix Attachment Preservation on Edit (Highest Priority)

Problem: When a JE is edited, the attachments are not being correctly preserved.
Action: You will debug the PUT /api/clients/:clientId/entities/:entityId/journal-entries/:id endpoint and its corresponding storage function, updateJournalEntryWithLines. My previous instructions on how to handle the files array in the payload and backend were correct. You will implement them now without error.
Ensure the frontend run_final_verification.js script, when it performs the PUT update, includes the files array containing the list of attachments that should remain.
Ensure the backend updateJournalEntryWithLines function correctly receives this files array.
Ensure the backend logic deletes any files from the database that are associated with the JE but are not in the incoming files array. This is the core of the synchronization logic.
Part 2: Fix Void and Reverse Logic

Problem: These operations are failing due to incorrect status validation or business logic.
Action:
Void: Review the POST .../:id/void endpoint. Ensure it correctly requires a voidReason and can only be performed on "Posted" entries.
Reverse: Review the POST .../:id/reverse endpoint. Ensure it correctly creates a new draft with inverted lines.
Part 3: Fix Automatic Accrual Reversal

Problem: This automated workflow is not complete.
Action: Review the PUT .../:id/post endpoint. The logic I specified previously was correct. When a JE with isAccrual: true is posted, the reverseJournalEntry function must be called immediately within the same transaction to create and post the reversal. You will complete this implementation.
After implementing the fixes for all three parts, run the run_final_verification.js script again.

I expect the complete and raw output from the script, and it must show 100% of the steps passing. This is the only acceptable outcome.
