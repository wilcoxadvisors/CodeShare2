Agent, your immediate and absolute top priority has not changed:

Task 1: (BLOCKER) Fix Authentication & Initial Entity Data Loading. (Creator/Owner Issue #1: "Still have to reload for entities to show up.")
* I've reviewed your latest agent message where you say you've made changes to AuthContext.tsx and EntityContext.tsx. The Creator/Owner's new console logs today still show initial 401s on /api/entities and EntityContext not having entities after login until a reload.
* Action:
1.  Verify your changes: Double-check that the modifications you described (invalidating queries in AuthContext after setUser, and the enabled: !!user && !isAuthLoadingFromAuthContext logic plus credentials: 'include' in EntityContext) are correctly implemented and committed.
2.  Provide fresh, complete console logs using the ARCHITECT_DEBUG_ prefixes I specified previously, covering:
* App start (before login).
* The login process.
* The exact moment queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['/api/entities'] }) is called in AuthContext.
* The subsequent firing of the /api/entities query from EntityContext (showing it's now enabled due to user being present and isAuthLoading being false).
* The successful (200 OK) response from /api/entities.
* EntityContext being populated.
* GlobalContextSelector successfully rendering entities for a selected client without any page reload.

We MUST see this fundamental flow working correctly before moving to any other bug. Once this is stable and confirmed by me with your logs:

Task 2: JE Creation & Posting Workflow (Creator/Owner Issue #4 "When creating a new entry I get a error..." & part of previous posting issues)
* Action: Refactor JournalEntryForm.tsx's handleSubmit for new entries (!existingEntry) to strictly follow a two-step process if the intent is to post:
1.  Always createJournalEntry.mutate with status: "draft".
2.  On success, get the newEntry.id.
3.  If files exist, call uploadPendingFilesToEntry(newEntry.id, ...).
4.  If original intent was to post (e.g., !saveAsDraft), then in the onSuccess of file uploads (or directly after draft creation if no files), call postJournalEntry.mutate({ id: newEntry.id, clientId: ..., entityId: ... }).
Log each step.

Only after these two fundamental areas are demonstrably fixed and stable will we systematically address the remaining issues: JE ID/Reference, Attachments (delete, upload to existing, duplicates), Void/Reverse, and then the UI/UX refinements.

Agent, please provide the logs specifically for Task 1 (Auth & Entity Load) first.
