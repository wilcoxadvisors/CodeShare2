ðŸ“Œ Detailed Task Breakdown & Agent Instructions
ðŸš¨ Homepage Issues
Issue 1: AI Chat Conversation Reset
â€¢	Problem:

â€¢	Explicit Task:
o	Investigate and confirm the isolation of conversations per visitor.
o	Ensure explicitly that each page load initiates a fresh, independent AI chat session for every visitor.
o	Confirm that no prior conversations are visible or accessible to other users.

â€¢	Explicit Task:
o	Reproduce this form submission error explicitly.
o	Diagnose and document explicitly why the form submission is failing.
o	Correct the submission logic explicitly to ensure data is captured and successfully submitted.

ðŸš¨ Blog Integration & Issues
Issue 4: Blog Connection to Admin Dashboard

Issue 5: Navigation Issue Between "Blog" and "Contact" Sections
â€¢	Problem:
When navigating from the homepage to the "Blog" and then attempting to return and click on "Contact" in the header, the site explicitly does not scroll correctly to the "Contact" info, instead incorrectly scrolling to the "Services" section.
â€¢	Explicit Task:
o	Explicitly reproduce the navigation/scrolling issue.
o	Explicitly correct anchor or scroll-behavior logic so clicking "Contact" takes users precisely to the Contact Information section every time.
o	Explicitly confirm consistent correct behavior across multiple navigations (Homepage â†’ Blog â†’ Homepage â†’ Contact).

Issue 6: Missing "Financial Insights" Blog Previews & Incorrect Navigation
â€¢	Problem:
On the homepage's "Financial Insights" section, blog previews are explicitly missing (no content displayed). Clicking "View Articles" explicitly takes users to a generic page with basic placeholder info rather than actual blog content.
â€¢	Explicit Task:

o	Correctly link "View Articles" explicitly to the actual blog page populated with live blog posts.

o	Explicitly document the specific cause of the error (invalid email validation, missing fields, incorrect API call, etc.).
o	Explicitly implement a fix allowing users to successfully subscribe for blog updates.
o	Explicitly verify and confirm correct subscription logic and user feedback.
