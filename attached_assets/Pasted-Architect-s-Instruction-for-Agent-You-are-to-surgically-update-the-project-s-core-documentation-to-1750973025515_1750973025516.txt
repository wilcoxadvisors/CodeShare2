### 2.A. Strategic Directive: Dual-Path Customer Experience

**1. Overview**

To broaden market reach and create a scalable, self-sufficient revenue stream, the Wilcox Advisors platform will support two distinct customer engagement models. This "Dual-Path" strategy is a core component of the business's long-term vision.

* **Path A: Wilcox Advisory Services (Full-Service Model):** This is the original, high-touch model. Clients engage directly with Wilcox Advisors for comprehensive accounting and financial advisory services, and the platform serves as the central workspace for collaboration. Onboarding is manual and personalized.

* **Path B: Wilcox Platform (Self-Service SaaS Model):** This new model is designed for users who want to leverage our powerful accounting software directly, without an accompanying advisory agreement. This path will be characterized by a public-facing marketing homepage, automated self-service signup, and a software-only subscription plan.

**2. Architectural & Roadmap Implications**

This directive necessitates foundational changes and additions to our strategic roadmap. The following items are now officially part of the development plan:

* **(New Epic) Public Website & Self-Service Funnel:**
    * **Task:** Design and build a public-facing marketing website.
    * **Requirement:** The homepage must clearly funnel visitors to either "Request a Consultation" (Path A) or "Sign Up Now" (Path B).

* **(New Epic) Automated User Onboarding:**
    * **Task:** Develop a fully automated, wizard-style onboarding flow for self-service users.
    * **Requirement:** This flow will guide users through account creation, plan selection, and initial entity setup without manual intervention.

* **(New Epic) Subscription & Billing Management:**
    * **Task:** Integrate a third-party payment and subscription management service (e.g., Stripe, Chargebee).
    * **Requirement:** The system must handle recurring billing, plan changes, and payment processing for self-service customers.

* **(Modification) Core Schema & Entitlements:**
    * **Task:** The database schema must be adapted to differentiate between the two service models.
    * **Requirement:** A `serviceStyle` attribute (`self_service` vs. `assisted`) will be added to the `plans` table to control feature entitlements for each path. This is the immediate, foundational priority.
