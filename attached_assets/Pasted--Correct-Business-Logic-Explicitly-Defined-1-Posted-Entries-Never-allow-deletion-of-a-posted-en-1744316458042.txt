✅ Correct Business Logic (Explicitly Defined):
1. Posted Entries
Never allow deletion of a posted entry explicitly.

Allow only:

Void action (Admin only, with reason explicitly required).

Reverse action (creates a reversal entry explicitly in draft).

2. Draft Entries
Allow explicit deletion.

If the draft entry is a reversal (explicitly linked to a posted entry):

Still explicitly allow deletion (draft reversal entries explicitly can be deleted without impacting posted entries).

📍 Issue You're Currently Facing:
Your error explicitly stated:

csharp
Copy
Edit
Error: Cannot delete journal entry: it is referenced by posted entry #97
Here, the backend explicitly prevents deleting draft reversal entries linked to a posted entry.

However, a draft reversal entry should explicitly be deletable—because the original posted entry is unaffected by deleting the draft reversal entry.

The issue explicitly lies in your backend's overly strict logic, where it's explicitly checking for referencing entries without properly differentiating between their statuses (posted vs. draft).

🔨 Corrected Backend Logic (Explicitly Recommended):
You explicitly need to adjust your deletion logic (deleteJournalEntry) in:

server/storage/journalEntryStorage.ts

Here's the correct implementation explicitly reflecting proper accounting system rules:

typescript
Copy
Edit
async deleteJournalEntry(id: number) {
  // Explicitly fetch the entry to delete
  const entryToDelete = await this.db.query.journal_entries.findFirst({
    where: eq(journal_entries.id, id),
  });

  if (!entryToDelete) {
    throw new Error(`Journal entry ${id} not found.`);
  }

  // Explicitly block deletion of POSTED entries
  if (entryToDelete.status === 'posted') {
    throw new Error(`Cannot delete a posted journal entry (#${id}). Explicitly void or reverse instead.`);
  }

  // Explicitly check if this entry has a POSTED reversal entry referencing it
  const referencingPostedReversalEntry = await this.db.query.journal_entries.findFirst({
    where: and(
      eq(journal_entries.reversal_of_id, id),
      eq(journal_entries.status, 'posted')
    ),
  });

  if (referencingPostedReversalEntry) {
    throw new Error(`Cannot delete journal entry: explicitly referenced by posted reversal entry #${referencingPostedReversalEntry.id}`);
  }

  // Explicitly allow deletion of DRAFT reversal entries or regular draft entries
  await this.db.transaction(async (trx) => {
    // Delete any referencing DRAFT reversal entries explicitly
    const referencingDraftReversalEntry = await trx.query.journal_entries.findFirst({
      where: and(
        eq(journal_entries.reversal_of_id, id),
        ne(journal_entries.status, 'posted')
      ),
    });

    if (referencingDraftReversalEntry) {
      await trx.delete(journal_entry_lines)
        .where(eq(journal_entry_lines.journal_entry_id, referencingDraftReversalEntry.id));
      await trx.delete(journal_entries)
        .where(eq(journal_entries.id, referencingDraftReversalEntry.id));
    }

    // Explicitly delete attachments, lines, and the entry itself
    await trx.delete(journal_entry_files)
      .where(eq(journal_entry_files.journal_entry_id, id));

    await trx.delete(journal_entry_lines)
      .where(eq(journal_entry_lines.journal_entry_id, id));

    await trx.delete(journal_entries)
      .where(eq(journal_entries.id, id));
  });
}
🧑‍💻 What This Corrected Logic Explicitly Does:
Never allows explicit deletion of a posted entry.

Explicitly blocks deletion if a posted reversal entry exists referencing the entry.

Explicitly allows deletion of draft reversal entries, even when referencing a posted entry.

Explicitly cleans up draft reversal entries when deleting the entry they reference.

🚩 Why Your Current Logic Failed Explicitly:
Your current backend logic did this:

Explicitly checked if any entry references the entry being deleted.

Did not explicitly differentiate based on the status (posted vs. draft).

This explicitly caused your backend to incorrectly block deletion of a draft reversal entry referencing a posted entry.

🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Explicitly):
Replace your current deletion logic explicitly with the corrected snippet above.

Restart your backend explicitly.

Retest your deletion scenario explicitly:

Try explicitly deleting a draft reversal entry again.

Verify explicitly the deletion succeeds.

Ensure explicitly posted entries remain explicitly blocked from deletion.
