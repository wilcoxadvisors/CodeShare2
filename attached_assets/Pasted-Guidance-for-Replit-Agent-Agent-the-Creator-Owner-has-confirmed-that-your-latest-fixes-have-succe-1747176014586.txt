Guidance for Replit Agent:

Agent, the Creator/Owner has confirmed that your latest fixes have successfully resolved the critical regression: they can now select clients and entities without getting stuck! This is excellent work and unblocks us significantly.

Now, we need to refine the User Experience of the GlobalContextSelector.tsx based on this feedback: "Just the entities associated with the client do not load right away. I should be able to expand the client and see the entities to chose when needed."

Your most recent changes involved auto-expanding all clients when the dropdown opens and using useMemo for initialExpandedState. This might be too aggressive. Let's refine this:

Task 1: (UX Refinement) Finalize Client/Entity Selector Hierarchical Display and Interaction

Objective: Ensure that when the GlobalContextSelector dropdown is opened, entities for the currently active client are immediately visible (i.e., that client is expanded), and the user can easily expand other clients to see their entities.

Action - Modify client/src/components/dashboard/GlobalContextSelector.tsx:

Controlled Expansion on Open:
Instead of auto-expanding all clients when the dropdown opens (if (open && Array.isArray(clients) && clients.length > 0) { ... allClientsExpanded ... }), modify this useEffect (or the initialExpandedState with useMemo):
When the dropdown open state becomes true, OR when clients or selectedClientId (from context) initially load/change:
The expandedClients state should be set such that only the client matching selectedClientId is initially expanded. All other clients should be collapsed by default.
If no selectedClientId is set (e.g., very first load, no persistence), then all clients can be initially collapsed.
console.log('ARCHITECT_DEBUG_SELECTOR_EXPAND: Setting initial expansion. Selected Client:', selectedClientId, 'Expanding only this client.');
Manual Expansion/Collapse:
Ensure the toggleClientExpansion(clientId) function correctly toggles the expansion state for the clicked client only, without affecting other clients' expansion states.
Selecting a Client:
When a user clicks on a client name in the dropdown:
The selectClient(clientId) function should be called.
This function should set the selectedClientId and clear the currentEntity (as it currently does).
It should also update expandedClients to ensure this newly selected client is now expanded (and others can remain as they were or collapse, discuss best UX with Creator/Owner if needed, but for now, just ensure selected is expanded).
If showEntities is false, the dropdown should close.
If showEntities is true, the dropdown should remain open, now showing the entities for the selected client, and the EntityContext's auto-entity-selection logic should pick the first entity.
Styling and showEntities Prop:
Your existing styling for hierarchy and the showEntities prop logic for hiding entities and adjusting checkmark display seems good. Ensure it's compatible with these refined expansion rules.
The status indicators for entities (active/inactive/deleted) are a good addition but per Creator/Owner feedback: "Color indicators are not needed. Only active entities should be showing up in under clients." Please update the entity filtering logic within GlobalContextSelector.tsx to only display entities where entity.active === true && entity.deletedAt === null, unless it's the currentEntity (which might be inactive but still selected). Remove the color dot status indicators for entities.
Testing & Verification:

Fresh Login (No Persisted Selection):
Open selector: All clients listed, likely collapsed.
Click Client A: Client A selected, Client A expands, its (active) entities are shown, first active entity auto-selected. JE list updates.
Open selector again: Client A is expanded, others collapsed.
Click expand icon on Client B: Client B expands showing its entities (Client A remains selected context).
Click Client B name: Client B becomes selected, Client B remains/is expanded, its first active entity auto-selected. JE list updates.
Return Visit (Persisted Client X, Entity Y):
Open selector: Client X is expanded, its entities shown, Entity Y highlighted. Other clients collapsed.
Manually select Client Z. Verify correct behavior.
Chart of Accounts (Simulate showEntities={false}):
Open selector. Select Client A. Dropdown closes. Client A is selected.
Provide ARCHITECT_DEBUG_ logs and a screenshot/GIF for these scenarios. Once the Creator/Owner confirms this refined selector UX, we will move to the critical JE functional bugs.
