ðŸŽ¯ Step-by-Step Verification Plan
âœ… Step 1: Verify Client Deletion UI
Open Dashboard.tsx and verify explicitly:

"Delete" button is present next to each client (for admin users only).

Ensure button is clearly labeled ("Delete").

Verify the button style clearly indicates a destructive action (e.g., red or similar warning color).

Check that clicking "Delete" explicitly triggers:

Confirmation modal/dialog clearly asking the user to confirm the deletion.

Modal/dialog explicitly states the clientâ€™s name or code for clarity.

âœ… Step 2: Verify Entity Deletion UI
Open EntityManagementCard.tsx explicitly:

Verify each entity row has an explicit "Delete" button.

Confirm explicit destructive styling for clarity.

Verify explicitly that clicking "Delete":

Opens a confirmation modal/dialog explicitly mentioning entity name or code.

Modal explicitly requires the user to confirm before proceeding.

âœ… Step 3: Verify Soft Deletion UX
Explicitly test soft-deletion of a client/entity:

Confirm the UI explicitly indicates the entity/client as inactive or deleted immediately after soft-deletion.

Verify that the soft-deleted client/entity explicitly no longer appears in standard views (e.g., active client list, entity dropdowns).

Explicitly verify soft-deleted clients/entities can be seen by admins:

Confirm explicit UI indicators (gray badge, italics, etc.) clearly show their deleted/inactive status.

âœ… Step 4: Verify Restoration UI
Explicitly verify presence of a "Restore" button for soft-deleted clients/entities (admin-only):

Confirm clear visibility and explicit labeling ("Restore").

Verify explicit styling indicates clearly that it's a restoration (non-destructive, positive action).

Verify restoration confirmation explicitly:

Clicking "Restore" explicitly triggers a clear confirmation prompt/modal.

Modal explicitly confirms entity/client restoration by name or code.

âœ… Step 5: Explicitly Verify Audit Logs for UI Actions
Check explicitly via the admin audit-log interface:

Confirm each deletion and restoration action explicitly generates a clear audit entry.

Audit entries explicitly state action type, entity/client identifiers, timestamps, and admin user performing the action.

âœ… Step 6: UI Clarity & UX Feedback
Explicitly verify:

All messages, prompts, buttons explicitly communicate their purpose clearly.

Users receive explicit, clear feedback after actions (successful deletion/restoration confirmation).
