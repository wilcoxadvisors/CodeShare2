Explicit Reasoning & Behavior for Chart of Accounts (CoA):
Reason (explicitly stated):

Each Client has its own unique Chart of Accounts (CoA).

All Entities under a single Client share the same CoA.

Therefore, when viewing/editing a CoA, the user only selects a Client; selecting an Entity is irrelevant and unnecessary.

Explicit Behavior to Implement:

Entities should never appear under any Client when the selector is used in the context of Chart of Accounts (CoA mode).

Selecting a Client in CoA mode should explicitly:

Immediately set the selected Client context.

Close the dropdown promptly.

Not attempt to load or display entities.

âœ… Explicit Implementation Instructions:
In your GlobalContextSelector.tsx component, make the following explicitly clear modification to ensure CoA mode (showEntities = false) behaves exactly as specified:

Current JSX (likely similar):

tsx
Copy
Edit
{showEntities && expandedClients[client.id] && (
  <ul>
    {entitiesByClient[client.id]?.map(entity => (
      <li key={entity.id} onClick={() => selectEntity(entity)}>
        {entity.name}
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>
)}
Explicitly Adjusted JSX (for CoA mode):

tsx
Copy
Edit
{showEntities && expandedClients[client.id] && (
  <ul>
    {entitiesByClient[client.id]?.map(entity => (
      <li key={entity.id} onClick={() => selectEntity(entity)}>
        {entity.name}
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>
)}
When showEntities explicitly equals false, entities will never render.

Additionally, explicitly ensure the dropdown closes immediately upon selecting a Client in CoA mode:

SelectClient function (explicitly updated):

tsx
Copy
Edit
const selectClient = (clientId: number) => {
  setSelectedClientId(clientId);
  setCurrentEntity(null);
  
  if (!showEntities) { // Explicitly check if it's CoA mode
    setOpen(false);    // Close dropdown immediately
  }
};
ðŸ“‹ Explicit Verification Steps After Implementation:
 In Chart of Accounts mode (showEntities=false), verify explicitly:

No entities display beneath any Client.

Selecting a Client immediately updates selection and closes the dropdown.

 Explicitly confirm no unintended behavior, such as auto-expansion or entity loading, occurs in CoA mode.

This explicit and precise implementation ensures your stated requirement regarding CoA functionality and entity visibility is clearly fulfilled.

Let me know if you need any further clarification, or confirm explicitly once you've tested and confirmed this behavior.
