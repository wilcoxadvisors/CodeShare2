Agent Instructions: STOP Edit Task & Verify Client/Entity Fixes FULLY

1. STOP: Immediately stop working on the "Edit Client" dialog implementation in Dashboard.tsx.

2. VERIFY getEntitiesByClient Fix & Entity Creation:

Goal: Confirm that implementing getEntitiesByClient allows the UI flow to work correctly for viewing and adding entities to existing clients, and that the previous 500 error is gone.
Action: Execute the full verification steps outlined previously (using stored credentials admin/password123):
Simulate logging in.
Simulate selecting an existing client in the dashboard.
Verify: Does the UI section that should display entities for this client now load without the getEntitiesByClient is not a function error? Does it display the correct entities (if any exist for that client)?
Simulate adding a new entity to this existing client.
Verify: Does the entity creation succeed via the API (no 500 error)? Is the new entity correctly associated with the client in the database? Does the UI update correctly (or can data be refetched) to show the newly added entity under that client?
Report: Detail the results of this verification. Specifically confirm:
Is the getEntitiesByClient error gone?
Can entities now be successfully added to existing clients without a 500 error?
Are entities displayed correctly per client?
3. IF VERIFICATION SUCCEEDS, THEN FIX CLIENT LIST DISPLAY:

Goal: Address the user's report that the "client status overview is still showing entities not clients".
Action:
Locate the component/section in client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx responsible for displaying the main list/table of clients (the "client status overview").
Examine the data fetching query used for this list (e.g., api.clients.getClients.useQuery or similar). Ensure it's fetching data from the clients endpoint/table.
Examine the rendering logic (.map()). Ensure it's iterating over the fetched client data and displaying client properties (e.g., client.name, client.status) not entity properties.
Correct the data fetching or rendering logic as needed to display the list of clients accurately.
Report: Explain the issue found and the fix applied to the client list display.
