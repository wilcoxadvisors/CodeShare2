Architect's Instructions for the Agent
Agent, I have reviewed the console logs. Your previous change to add logging was successful, and the logs have revealed the problem.

Root Cause Analysis:

The critical log message is:
JournalEntryDetail.tsx:1617 ARCHITECT_DEBUG: Entry data for button rendering: Object

While the log shows that the entry object exists, it crucially does not show the status property within that object. Looking at the surrounding logs, I can see a flurry of component re-renders and context updates. It appears the component is rendering once with entry as undefined, and then again with the entry object after the data is fetched.

The most likely cause is that the initial render passes undefined to the button logic, and a subsequent render with the correct data is not correctly updating the button's visibility.

To fix this definitively, we will make two changes:

Make the diagnostic log more explicit to avoid object collapsing in the browser console.
Add a defensive guard to the button rendering logic to ensure it only attempts to render when the entry data is fully loaded.
Task: Implement the Definitive Fix

Modify the Diagnostic Log:

File: client/src/features/journal-entries/pages/JournalEntryDetail.tsx
Action: Find the ARCHITECT_DEBUG log you added and replace it with the following to make the status explicit:
JavaScript

console.log(`ARCHITECT_DEBUG: Button visibility check. Entry ID: ${entry?.id}, Status: ${entry?.status}`);
Add a Guard to the Button UI:

File: client/src/features/journal-entries/pages/JournalEntryDetail.tsx

Action: Find the JSX code that renders the action buttons (Edit, Copy, etc.). Wrap the entire button group in a conditional check that ensures entry exists before trying to render any buttons.

Example Implementation:

JavaScript

// Find the existing button group, which might look something like this:
<div className="flex space-x-2">
    {/* ... existing buttons like Edit, Void, etc. ... */}
    {status === 'posted' && (
        <Button onClick={() => copyJournalEntry.mutate()}>Copy</Button>
    )}
</div>

// Wrap it like this:
{entry && (
    <div className="flex space-x-2">
        {/* ... existing buttons like Edit, Void, etc. ... */}
        {entry.status === 'posted' && (
            <Button onClick={() => copyJournalEntry.mutate()}>Copy</Button>
        )}
    </div>
)}
Self-correction: You must also change status to entry.status inside the button logic to reference the guarded entry object.

After implementing these two changes, please confirm the fix and I will instruct the user to test again.
