The final task for the Journal Entry UI fixes is to implement the ability to attach supporting documents (Issue #7). This requires both backend and frontend changes.

Objective: Allow users to upload files related to a journal entry and view/download attached files.

Backend Tasks:

Storage Logic (server/storage/journalEntryStorage.ts):

Implement the createJournalEntryFile function:
It should receive file metadata (filename, mimeType, size, etc.), the journalEntryId, and the uploadedBy user ID.
It needs to handle actual file storage (e.g., save the file to a designated uploads directory on the server, or to a cloud storage service like S3 - confirm the desired storage strategy). Store the resulting file path or identifier.
Insert a record into the journalEntryFiles table (defined in shared/schema.ts) with the metadata and storage path/identifier.
Return the created database record.
Implement the getJournalEntryFiles function:
It should query the journalEntryFiles table for all records associated with a given journalEntryId.
Return the list of file records.
API Routes (server/journalEntryRoutes.ts):

Create a POST route: /api/journal-entries/:id/files
Use multer middleware to handle multipart/form-data file uploads. Configure storage (e.g., multer.diskStorage or memory storage if uploading to cloud).
Extract the journalEntryId (:id) from the route parameters.
Extract the uploaded file details (req.file) provided by multer.
Extract the user ID (req.user.id).
Call journalEntryStorage.createJournalEntryFile with the necessary information.
Return the created file record (e.g., 201 Created).
Create a GET route: /api/journal-entries/:id/files
Extract the journalEntryId (:id).
Call journalEntryStorage.getJournalEntryFiles.
Return the list of file records (e.g., 200 OK).
(Optional/Advanced) Create a GET route: /api/journal-entry-files/:fileId/download (or similar) to handle secure downloading of the actual file content, setting appropriate headers (Content-Disposition, Content-Type).
Frontend Tasks:

UI Elements (JournalEntryForm.tsx or JournalEntryDetail.tsx):

Add a section (likely on the detail page or in the edit form) to display attached files.
Add UI for uploading files (e.g., a "Upload Attachment" button triggering a file input, or a drag-and-drop zone).
Upload Logic:

When a file is selected, use the FormData API to prepare the data for the multipart/form-data request.
Create/use a mutation hook (useUploadAttachment) to call the POST /api/journal-entries/:id/files endpoint.
Handle loading states, success (refresh file list), and error responses (show toast).
Display/Download Logic:

Create/use a query hook (useGetAttachments) to call the GET /api/journal-entries/:id/files endpoint to fetch the list of attached files for the current entry.
Display the list (e.g., filenames).
Make filenames clickable to trigger downloads (linking to the download endpoint or handling download logic).
Report: Confirm implementation of backend storage functions, API routes (including multer setup), frontend UI elements, and frontend hooks/logic for upload and display.
