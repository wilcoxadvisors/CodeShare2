Prompt for Replit Agent (JE Attachment Debug - Part 1):

"The Edit route and Reversal logic are now confirmed fixed. However, the user tested the File Attachment feature (Issue #7, Checkpoint 68c54be1) and reported multiple critical failures: only the last file is saved during multi-upload, the file list doesn't display, download/delete don't work, and files disappear after posting. We need to add detailed logging to debug the core multi-file upload and list display flow.

Tasks:

Verify/Add Backend Upload & Storage Logging:

Go to server/journalEntryRoutes.ts, find POST /api/journal-entries/:id/files.
Add/Ensure Logging:
Log req.files received from multer: console.log('DEBUG Attach BE: Received req.files:', req.files);
Inside the file processing loop (iterating req.files), log the file being processed and data sent to storage: console.log('DEBUG Attach BE: Processing file:', file.originalname, ' Data to storage:', dataForStorage);
Check for and log any errors during file moving/saving (e.g., fs.rename if used).
Go to server/storage/journalEntryStorage.ts, find createJournalEntryFile.
Add/Ensure Logging: Log data received and DB insert result: console.log('DEBUG Attach Storage: createJournalEntryFile called with:', fileData); and console.log('DEBUG Attach Storage: Insert result:', insertResult);
Verify/Add Backend File List Retrieval Logging:

Go to server/journalEntryRoutes.ts, find GET /api/journal-entries/:id/files.
Add/Ensure Logging: Log result from storage before sending response: console.log('DEBUG Attach BE: Files retrieved for entry', req.params.id, ':', files);
Go to server/storage/journalEntryStorage.ts, find getJournalEntryFiles.
Add/Ensure Logging: Log the result of the DB query: console.log('DEBUG Attach Storage: getJournalEntryFiles DB result:', queryResult);
Verify/Add Frontend File List Fetching Logging:

Go to client/src/features/journal-entries/pages/JournalEntryDetail.tsx.
Find the useQuery hook for attachments (useGetAttachments?).
Add/Ensure Logging: Log the data returned by the hook: console.log('DEBUG Attach FE: Data from useGetAttachments:', data);
Verify/Add Frontend List Rendering Logging:

In JournalEntryDetail.tsx, find the JSX mapping over the fetched file list (filesData?.files.map(...)).
Add/Ensure Logging: Inside the map, log each file being rendered: console.log('DEBUG Attach FE: Rendering file list item:', file);
Re-run Test:

Ask the user to go to an existing journal entry (e.g., a draft one accessed via the now-working edit route), upload two different allowed files (e.g., PDF, JPG) using drag-drop or the button.
Then, ask the user to reload the page.
Report Findings:

Provide the output of all the DEBUG logs (Backend Upload, Backend List, Frontend Fetch, Frontend Render) from this test.
Did the backend log show both files being received and processed/saved?
Did the backend log show both files being retrieved when listing?
Did the frontend log show both files being received from the API after the page reload?
Did the frontend log show it attempting to render both file list items?
This detailed trace will help us find where the multi-file upload or list display is breaking down."
