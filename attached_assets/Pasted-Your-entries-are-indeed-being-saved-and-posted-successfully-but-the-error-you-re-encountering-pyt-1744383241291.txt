Your entries are indeed being saved and posted successfully, but the error you're encountering:

python
Copy
Edit
Error posting journal entry: TypeError: Cannot set property status of #<Response> which has only a getter
is related to how the frontend code in your queryClient.ts handles API responses. Specifically, the error occurs when the frontend attempts to set or modify the status property directly on a fetch Response object, which is read-only by default.

🚩 Why This Error Occurs:
The fetch Response object returned by fetch in JavaScript is immutable. Attempting to assign values directly to its properties (such as status) causes this error.

📍 How to Fix This:
You need to ensure that your apiRequest function does not directly modify the Response object. Instead, clone or create a new object based on the response and add properties to that new object.

✅ Example of a Proper Implementation:
Here's how you can correctly handle response data:

typescript
Copy
Edit
async function apiRequest(url: string, options?: RequestInit) {
  const response = await fetch(url, options);
  const data = await response.json();

  const result = {
    ok: response.ok,
    status: response.status,
    data,  // add response body to a new object
  };

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw result; // Throw the new object if error
  }

  return result; // Return the new object on success
}
🔧 Apply This Fix:
Update your existing apiRequest in queryClient.ts as follows:

Before (Problematic code snippet):

typescript
Copy
Edit
const response = await fetch(url, options);
response.status = response.status; // 🚫 causes error
After (Corrected implementation):

typescript
Copy
Edit
const response = await fetch(url, options);
const responseData = await response.json();

const formattedResponse = {
  status: response.status,
  ok: response.ok,
  data: responseData,
};

if (!response.ok) {
  throw formattedResponse;
}

return formattedResponse;
📋 Result of this fix:
No more TypeError about setting a read-only property.

Proper handling and clear response data for the frontend.

🎯 Next Steps:
Implement this fix explicitly in queryClient.ts.

Re-test your journal entry posting to ensure error messages no longer appear.
