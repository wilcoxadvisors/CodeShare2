    * Ensure these modules integrate with the Chart of Accounts and General Ledger.
    * Design and implement GAAP/IFRS compliant financial statements with footnotes.

**Phase C: Reporting (Standard & Custom) & Data Collection**

* **(Task C.1)** **Standard Reporting:** Finalize/optimize backend logic (`consolidation-group-methods.ts`) for TB, IS, BS, CF reports. Build reliable frontend display components.
* **(Task C.2)** **Custom Reporting:**

    * Define backend API capabilities for fetching data with flexible filters (dates, entities, accounts, custom tags).
    * Build a frontend UI allowing users to select fields, apply filters, and save custom report layouts.
* **(Task C.3)** **Data Collection and Analysis:**

    * Implement data collection mechanisms to gather user data for analysis and potential sale.
    * Ensure robust anonymization, transparent privacy policies, and explicit user consent are in place.
    * Design the system to maximize data availability for AI/ML and forecasting.
    * Prioritize state-of-the-art, innovative, customer-focused, and easy-to-use solutions.
    * Create a great design that influences emotions such as trust, and is trendy and fun.

**Phase D: API Integrations & Automation**

* **(Task D.1)** **Implement Integrations:** Connect to Plaid, Stripe, Gusto, Ramp/Concur etc., storing credentials securely [cite: uploaded:Outline for Accounting System Integration.docx].
* **(Task D.2)** **Automate JE Creation:** Implement logic to automatically generate Journal Entries from fetched API data (bank transactions, payroll runs, invoices, expenses), mapping them to the CoA (potentially with AI assistance for categorization).

**Phase E: AI/ML & Predictive Forecasting**

* **(Task E.1)** **Verify Python Service Integration:** Ensure `python_service/ml_service.py` has secure, reliable read/write access to relevant PostgreSQL tables (GL, JE, Budgets, Forecasts) using env variables. Document permissions.
* **(Task E.2)** **Implement AI/ML and Predictive Forecasting:**

    * Integrate AI/ML models and techniques for predictive forecasting, transaction auto-categorization, anomaly detection, and NLP queries.
    * Ensure AI/ML is inclusive of every aspect of the accounting system.
    * Design and implement advanced analytics features.
    * Prioritize state-of-the-art, innovative, customer-focused, and easy-to-use AI/ML solutions.
    * Strive for a great design that influences emotions such as trust, and is trendy and fun.

## 5. General Guidelines for Agent

* **Prioritize:** Ensure the Chart of Accounts is solid, adaptable, and customizable before proceeding with Journal Entries.
* **Maintain Structure:** Keep the client-specific accounting design consistent across features.
* **Test Thoroughly:** Ensure all functionality works with the new combined client-entity context selector.
* **Log When Needed:** Use `console.log("DEBUG Component: Action:", value)` for tracing complex logic.
* **Verify Incrementally:** Test each specific feature thoroughly before moving to the next.
* **Simplify:** Avoid unnecessary complexity. Focus on clean state management.
* **Ask for Clarification:** If unsure, ask before proceeding.
* **Design Considerations:** Prioritize state-of-the-art, innovative, customer-focused, and easy-to-use design in every aspect of the system. Strive for a great design that influences emotions such as trust, and is trendy and fun.
* **Data Strategy:** Implement data collection mechanisms to enable selling data and creating valuable reports for investors and economists. Ensure robust anonymization, transparent privacy policies, and explicit user consent are in place. Design the system to maximize data availability for AI/ML and forecasting.
* **Code Quality:** Write clean, well-organized, and well-documented code to avoid confusion and ensure maintainability.
* **Efficiency:** Prioritize efficient algorithms and data structures for optimal performance.
* **Testing:** Implement comprehensive automated test scripts to ensure functionality and prevent regressions.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error catching and user-friendly error messages for both users and administrators.
* **Documentation:** Maintain great documentation, including clear file and directory organization, so human coders and AI can easily understand the codebase and its functionality.
