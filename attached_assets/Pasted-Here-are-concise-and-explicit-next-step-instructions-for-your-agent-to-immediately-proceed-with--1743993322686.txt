Here are concise and explicit **next-step instructions** for your agent to immediately proceed with:

## âœ… **Immediate Next Steps for Task B.1 (Chart of Accounts)**

### ðŸ“Œ **1. Identify & Fix Import/Export Functionality (Highest Priority)**

- **Explicitly test import/export** using the current UI (`client/src/components/account/ChartOfAccountsImportExport.tsx`).
- Check backend endpoints (`server/accountRoutes.ts`).
- Identify and explicitly document any issues caused by recent refactoring:
  - Missing fields
  - Incorrect mappings
  - Error handling issues
  - UI responsiveness and validation
- Explicitly fix these issues and clearly document the resolutions.

### ðŸ“Œ **2. Verify & Document Hierarchical Integrity**

- Explicitly ensure the hierarchical structure of CoA is stable and consistent:
  - Verify entity-specific hierarchies (`accountStorage.ts`).
  - Ensure accounts correctly roll up under their parents.
- Provide explicit examples in documentation of verified successful hierarchies.

### ðŸ“Œ **3. UI/UX Finalization**

- Clearly verify and finalize UI improvements:
  - Explicit error messages on failed import/export.
  - Clear user feedback on validation errors.
  - Improve overall UI responsiveness explicitly for large datasets.

### ðŸ“Œ **4. Comprehensive Testing & Edge-Case Handling**

- Explicitly create test cases for:
  - Duplicate accounts
  - Invalid formats
  - Updates versus new account handling
- Run and clearly document test results.

## ðŸš© **Continuous Refactoring & Code Quality Checks (During Task B.1)**

- Explicitly ensure all new changes follow modular architecture principles.
- Immediately remove duplicate, outdated, or unused code.
- Run explicitly:
  ```bash
  npx ts-prune
  npx knip
  ```
- Document explicitly any removals clearly for future reference.

## ðŸ“‹ **Explicit Task Completion Checklist (for Task B.1):**

- [ ] Import/export explicitly working post-refactoring.
- [ ] UI/UX enhancements explicitly completed and verified.
- [ ] Comprehensive edge-case testing explicitly documented.
- [ ] Continuous refactoring clearly visible and verified.
- [ ] Unused code detection scripts (`ts-prune`, `knip`) explicitly run and results addressed.
