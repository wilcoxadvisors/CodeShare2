Architect's Instruction for the Replit AI Agent
Status Review: The previous fixes were insufficient. The user has confirmed that saving accrual data is still failing for both drafts and posted entries.

Your Mission: You will execute a precise, two-part fix targeting the identified bugs in the frontend state management and the backend creation logic.

Part 1: Fix the Frontend State Synchronization Bug
File to Modify: client/src/features/journal-entries/components/JournalEntryForm.tsx

Action: You will replace the flawed useEffect hook that is overwriting user input with a more intelligent version that only sets the initial state from the existingEntry once.

Locate the useEffect hook that watches for changes in existingEntry.

Replace the entire hook with the following implementation. This version uses a useRef to ensure it only populates the form from the prop once, allowing the user's subsequent changes to be preserved.

TypeScript

const isInitialLoad = useRef(true);

useEffect(() => {
  // Only set the form state from the prop on the initial load.
  // After that, the component manages its own state.
  if (existingEntry && isInitialLoad.current) {
    console.log("DEBUG: Setting initial form state from existingEntry prop.");
    setJournalData({
      reference: existingEntry.referenceNumber || generateReference(),
      referenceNumber: existingEntry.referenceNumber || autoReferencePrefix,
      referenceUserSuffix: existingEntry.referenceNumber ? existingEntry.referenceNumber.split(':')[1] || "" : "",
      date: existingEntry.date ?? getTodayYMD(),
      description: existingEntry.description || "",
      status: existingEntry.status || JournalEntryStatus.DRAFT,
      journalType: existingEntry.journalType || "JE",
      supDocId: existingEntry.supDocId || "",
      isAccrual: existingEntry.isAccrual || false,
      reversalDate: existingEntry.reversalDate ?? ""
    });
    isInitialLoad.current = false;
  }
}, [existingEntry]); // Dependency on existingEntry is correct.
Part 2: Fix the Backend Draft Saving Bug
File to Modify: shared/validation.ts

Action: You must ensure the Zod validation schema explicitly includes the isAccrual and reversalDate fields. The agent's logs claimed this was done, but we must be certain.

Open shared/validation.ts and locate the createJournalEntrySchema.

Verify or add the following fields to the schema definition.

TypeScript

// Inside createJournalEntrySchema
const createJournalEntrySchema = z.object({
    // ... other fields
    description: z.string().min(1, "Description is required"),
    isAccrual: z.boolean().optional(), // Ensure this exists
    reversalDate: z.string().optional().nullable(), // Ensure this exists
    // ...
});
Agent, these two fixes are precise and target the identified root causes. Implement them now. The user's time has been wasted, and we must resolve this.
