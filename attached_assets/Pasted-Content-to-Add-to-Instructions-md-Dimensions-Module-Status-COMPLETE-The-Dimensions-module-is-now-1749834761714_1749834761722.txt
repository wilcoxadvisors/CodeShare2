Dimensions Module - Status: COMPLETE

The Dimensions module is now feature-complete and stable. This includes a full suite of tools for creating, managing, and utilizing financial dimensions.

Key Completed Features:

Core CRUD Functionality:

Full UI and backend support for creating, editing, and deleting Dimensions.
A dedicated "Manage Values" dialog for adding, editing, deactivating, and deleting dimension values.
Implemented safety checks to prevent deletion of any dimension or value that is currently in use in a transaction, ensuring data integrity.
COA-Style Master Bulk Management:

A centralized "Master Bulk Management" feature is now available on the main Dimensions page.
Master Template Download: Users can download a single, clean CSV template pre-populated with all values for all dimensions for the selected client.
Interactive Upload & Preview: When a master CSV is uploaded, the system now performs an analysis and displays a detailed preview of all proposed changes (Creations, Updates, Deletions).
Inline Editing: The preview screen is fully interactive, allowing users to edit names, descriptions, and the active/inactive status of values before confirming.
Intelligent Sync Logic: The system uses "delete by omission," meaning any value not present in the uploaded file is automatically marked for deletion, allowing for true synchronization.
User Confirmation: All changes from a bulk upload are only applied to the database after explicit user confirmation from the preview screen.
Journal Entry Integration:

The "Dimension Tagging" feature within the Journal Entry form is now fully functional.
All bugs related to fetching and displaying dimension data in the tagging popover have been resolved.
Data Integrity and Security:

A critical cross-client data contamination issue was discovered and fully resolved.
The database has been hardened with new triggers and constraints to enforce strict client data isolation, preventing this category of bugs from occurring in the future.
