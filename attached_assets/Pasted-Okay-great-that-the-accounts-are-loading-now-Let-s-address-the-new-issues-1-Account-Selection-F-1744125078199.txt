Okay, great that the accounts are loading now! Let's address the new issues:

1. Account Selection Field Not User-Friendly (Missing Account Number)

Critique: You're right, just showing the account name makes selection difficult, especially with similar names.
Evidence: The console logs confirm this. Lines like DEBUG Account Select - rendering account option: undefined Assets show that only the account name (Assets) is being displayed, and the preceding value (which should be the accountCode) is undefined in the log output format, but likely just not being included in the displayed text.
Root Cause: The problem is almost certainly in the frontend component rendering the options for the account <select> dropdown inside JournalEntryForm.tsx. The code generating the text for each option is likely only using account.name.
Recommendation: Modify the code within JournalEntryForm.tsx where the account options are mapped and rendered. Instead of just displaying account.name, format the display text to include both the accountCode and name. For example:
JavaScript

// Example of how you might format the option text
<option key={account.id} value={account.id}>
  {`${account.accountCode} - ${account.name}`} {/* <-- Combine code and name */}
</option>

// Or if using Shadcn Select:
<SelectItem key={account.id} value={String(account.id)}>
  {account.accountCode} - {account.name} {/* <-- Combine code and name */}
</SelectItem>
This will make the dropdown show entries like "1110 - Cash", making selection much easier.
2. Cannot Post Journal Entry (400 Bad Request)

Critique: The inability to post the entry indicates the server is rejecting the data submission due to invalid input.
Evidence: The console clearly shows the submission attempt (DEBUG JournalEntryForm - Journal entry submission data: {...}) followed immediately by the API error: Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 (Bad Request). A 400 Bad Request specifically means the server understood the request but refused to process it because the data sent was invalid according to its rules.
Potential Causes:
Incorrect Initial Status: The logged submission data shows "status": "posted". Most workflows require entries to be created as "draft" first. The API endpoint (POST /api/journal-entries) is likely configured to reject direct creation of entries with a "posted" status. The status should likely be changed through separate approval/posting endpoints later (as outlined in README-journal-api-improvements.md).
Backend Validation Failure: Even if the status is correct, the data might be failing server-side validation (createJournalEntrySchema). Looking at the payload ({"reference":"JE-2025-0974","date":"2025-04-08","description":"","status":"posted", ...}), the description is empty. Is the description field mandatory on the backend? Are there other required fields missing or data types incorrect? The backend validation might be stricter than the frontend's.
Invalid IDs/Codes: Less likely if selection worked, but ensure the accountIds (7890, 7894) and the entityCode ("GCW90") used in the lines are valid, active, and correctly associated with the clientId (250) and entityId (391) being submitted.
Recommendations:
Check Submitted Status: Modify the onSubmit handler in JournalEntryForm.tsx to ensure it sends the new journal entry with status: 'draft' (or whatever the correct initial status should be).
Review Backend Validation: Examine the Zod schema (createJournalEntrySchema?) used by the POST /api/journal-entries route handler in the backend (server/journalEntryRoutes.ts?). Check all required fields and validation rules.
Add Server-Side Logging: Add detailed logging within the backend API endpoint specifically for validation failures. Log exactly which validation rule failed and for which field. This will pinpoint the exact data issue causing the 400 error.
The primary suspects for the 400 error are submitting with the wrong initial status ("posted" instead of "draft") or failing a specific backend validation rule (like a required description).
