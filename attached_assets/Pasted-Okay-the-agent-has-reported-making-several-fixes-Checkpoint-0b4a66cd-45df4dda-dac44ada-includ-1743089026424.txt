Okay, the agent has reported making several fixes (Checkpoint: 0b4a66cd, 45df4dda, dac44ada), including addressing the "Back" button behavior again and standardizing active/isActive.

However, before we assume everything is resolved, we need the agent to perform one comprehensive verification run covering all the specific bugs you reported finding during your last test of the setup flow.

Agent Instructions: Comprehensive Verification of 3-Step Setup Flow Fixes

Goal: Systematically verify that all previously reported bugs in the 3-step "Add Client" flow (Entity Management, Summary, Finish) are now resolved following the latest code changes. Use stored credentials (admin/password123).

Reminder: Perform checks by analyzing code execution, component state, API calls/responses, database state, and logs, simulating the user journey step-by-step.

Verification Steps (Execute Sequentially & Report on Each):

Start Flow & Verify Step 1:
Simulate login and click "Add Client" to open the setup modal.
Quickly verify Step 1 (ClientSetupCard) appears correctly. Submit valid client info.
Verify: Does it successfully navigate to Step 2?
Verify Step 2 (EntityManagementCard) - Initial State & Add First Entity:
Verify: Does Step 2 start with an empty entity list?
Simulate adding the first entity (e.g., "Entity C1").
Verify: Does it save successfully (API call returns success, check logs)?
Verify: Does "Entity C1" appear correctly in the list within Step 2? Are all necessary attributes (Name, Industry, Code, etc.) displayed correctly in the list/table row? (User reported missing attributes previously).
Verify Step 2 - "Back" Button Behavior:
With "Entity C1" visible in the list, simulate clicking the "Back" button.
Simulate clicking the "Next/Continue" button on Step 1 to return to Step 2.
Verify: Is "Entity C1" still present in the entity list? (The agent's fix 45df4dda should ensure it persists).
Verify Step 2 - Add Second Entity:
With "Entity C1" present, simulate adding a second entity (e.g., "Entity C2").
Verify: Can the second entity be added successfully (API success)?
Verify: Does "Entity C2" appear in the list alongside "Entity C1"?
Verify Step 2 - Deletion During Setup:
With both entities present, simulate clicking the delete button for "Entity C1".
Verify: Is "Entity C1" successfully removed from the setupEntities state and the displayed list? Does the corresponding DELETE API call succeed (if applicable at this stage)?
Verify Step 3 (SetupSummaryCard) - Data Display:
Navigate forward to Step 3 (Summary) (only "Entity C2" should remain from the previous steps).
Verify: Does the Summary card correctly display the details of the client (from Step 1) and the remaining entity ("Entity C2")? Add console logs in SetupSummaryCard to check received props if necessary.
Verify Step 3 - "Finish" Action & Client List Update:
Simulate clicking the "Finish Setup" button on the Summary card.
Analyze: Does the modal/dialog close?
Verify Query Invalidation: Check logs or analyze code execution. Is the TanStack Query invalidation being called correctly (queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['clients'] }))?
Verify Client List Update (Simulated): Analyze the expected result. After invalidation, the main dashboard's client list fetch should re-run. Would the newly created client now appear in that list based on the fetched data?
Overall Console/Log Check:
Review browser console and server logs throughout this entire simulated flow for any errors or warnings (including React key warnings).
Report Findings: Provide a clear, step-by-step report confirming the success or failure of each specific verification point listed above. Explicitly state if deleting entities during setup works, if data persists during back/forward navigation, if the summary displays data, and if the final query invalidation occurs.
