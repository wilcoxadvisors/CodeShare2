Next Immediate Action (Before starting Task B.3)
First, perform an explicit and comprehensive verification of all previously completed tasks. We will methodically confirm each feature is working correctly to your standards, with particular focus on Phase 2 and Phase 3 (Tasks B.1 & B.2). Follow these steps explicitly:

üìù Explicit Verification Steps
Phase 2: Client & Entity Setup Flow
Client Onboarding Flow (SetupStepper.tsx):

Verify step-by-step client creation is intuitive and stable.

Ensure client data saves explicitly to PostgreSQL correctly.

Explicitly confirm navigation (forward/back) maintains state correctly.

Entity Management:

Explicitly confirm CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) function accurately.

Ensure entities link explicitly and correctly to the client.

Explicitly confirm UI clearly displays entity hierarchy.

Consolidation Groups (if applicable):

Confirm explicit database linkage for consolidation groups.

Verify the UI accurately displays consolidated entities.

Phase 3 (B.1): Chart of Accounts (CoA)
Hierarchical CoA Management:

Explicitly verify CRUD (Create/Update/Delete) operations on accounts.

Confirm the UI explicitly matches data stored in PostgreSQL.

Import/Export Functionality (CSV/Excel):

Explicitly confirm import/export operations work accurately, with validation checks clearly implemented.

Verify imported accounts explicitly reflect changes correctly.

Schema Verification:

Confirm fields explicitly moved (fsliBucket, internalReportingBucket, item) from accounts ‚Üí journalEntryLines.

Explicitly verify database schema and storage module reflect this accurately.

Phase 3 (B.2): General Ledger & Journal Entries
(This step will require the most explicit verification.)

Manual Journal Entry Creation (UI/UX):

Explicitly test creating, updating, deleting manual journal entries through the UI (ManualJournalEntry.tsx).

Confirm journal entries explicitly reflect accurately in the database.

Journal Entry Validation (debits = credits):

Verify the explicit validation rule is enforced clearly.

Batch Upload Journal Entries:

Explicitly test CSV/Excel uploads with multiple journal entries.

Confirm explicit validation, error handling, and success messaging.

Ensure data explicitly reflects accurately in the database post-upload.

General Ledger UI & Reporting:

Explicitly confirm the general ledger UI retrieves correct journal entries.

Ensure filtering, sorting, and reporting explicitly match data correctly.
