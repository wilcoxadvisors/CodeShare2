We finally have a working render-guard component, but it can only run if React is actually mounting it inside your router.
The runtime log shows no values after JR guards…, which means the guard line ran before any context was available.
That happens when JournalRedirector isn’t inside the <EntityProvider> scope or the route nesting is different from what <Outlet/> expects.

3-point checklist to wire it up
✅ Step	What to verify	Why it matters
1. Provider order	In App.tsx (or main.tsx) wrap the whole router in the entity provider: tsx\n<EntityProvider>\n <RouterProvider router={router} />\n</EntityProvider>	Redirector can’t read entities unless the provider is higher in the tree.
2. Route nesting	In your router file the JE pages must sit inside /journal-entries, like: tsx\n<Route path=\"/journal-entries\" element={<JournalRedirector />}> \n <Route path=\"list/:entityId\" element={<JournalEntries />} />\n <Route path=\"detail/:jeId\" element={<JournalEntryDetail />} />\n <Route path=\"new/:entityId\" element={<NewJournalEntry />} />\n</Route>	<Outlet/> in the redirector only renders children that are nested exactly like this.
3. Context shape	In EntityContext.tsx the value passed to the provider includes: ts\nvalue={{\n entities, // filtered by selectedClientId\n currentEntity, // null until user picks one\n isInitialLoading, // true until first fetch resolves\n}}\n	The guard uses these three keys—nothing else is required.

Sanity-test script
Hard refresh (⌘⇧R / Ctrl-F5) after saving the three files.

Console at /journal-entries right after login should print:

yaml
Copy
Edit
JR guards { init: false, entities: 0, hasCurrent: false }
→ placeholder renders.

Pick a client/entity → console prints:

yaml
Copy
Edit
JR guards { init: false, entities: 1, hasCurrent: true }
→ JE list renders.

If it’s still blank
Add this one liner at the top of JournalRedirector and paste the result:

tsx
Copy
Edit
console.log('JR guards', {
  init: isInitialLoading,
  entities: entities?.length,
  hasCurrent: !!currentEntity,
});
If entities is ever undefined, the component is definitely outside the provider; fixing Step 1 will solve it.

Once those three wiring points are correct, the guard component you’ve just copied cannot loop—React will always render either the spinner, the placeholder, or the JE pages.

Let me know what the guard log prints after these checks, and we’ll close the loop for good.
