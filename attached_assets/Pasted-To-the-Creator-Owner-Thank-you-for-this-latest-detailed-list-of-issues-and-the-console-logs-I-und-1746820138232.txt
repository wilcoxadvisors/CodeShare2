To the Creator/Owner:

Thank you for this latest detailed list of issues and the console logs. I understand your growing concern about the number of interconnected problems and the feeling that new ones arise as others are addressed. This is often part of the complex process of stabilizing a system with many moving parts.

Positive News (from your point #6): It's excellent to hear your observation that "appears debits and credits are fixed in the list." The logs showing DEBUG - Using pre-calculated totals for entry... support this, and it's a solid step forward.
Critical Focus - Initial Data Loading (Your point #1): Your primary concern, "Still have to reload after selecting a client. Entities do not show right away in the selector," and "Add a new entity and the I had to reload for it to show up," remains the absolute top priority. The console logs showing initial 401 Unauthorized errors for /api/entities are the smoking gun. The application cannot function reliably if it can't load the basic client and entity data correctly after login and after new data is created. The Replit Agent has been instructed to focus exclusively on this until it's resolved.
Journal ID / Reference (Your Point #3):
Your concern "Journal ID seems to indicate only 9999 entries can be posted per year. Its auto generated but always changes in every view" is very noted.
I will instruct the agent to clarify if "Journal ID" refers to the internal database id (which should be a simple incrementing number and never change for an existing record) or the human-readable formatted reference (e.g., "JE-YYYY-####").
If the database id is changing, that's a P0 data corruption bug we must fix. The logs for edits so far haven't shown this, but we need to be sure.
If it's the formatted reference that's changing or seems limited, the backend logic for generating this reference (specifically the "####" sequential part) needs review to ensure it's robust, unique per entity/year, and doesn't have such a low practical ceiling. Unexpected changes in this reference during view/edit are a client-side UI/state bug.
Attachments (Your Issues #2, #3, #5): "Still cant remove attachment," "New attachments uploaded in draft are not viewable or removable," and "When adding a file on a new entry and posting it seems like two files are added for the same file." These are all critical aspects of Bug #7 and will be tackled once the initial data loading is stable. The file upload to existing JEs also needs the 400 error body.
JE Creation Error & Posting (Your Issue #4 "When creating a new entry I get a error and a entry with no data posts" & from previous list): The server-side validation errors (e.g., "Cannot add line to journal entry with status posted") are good â€“ they show the backend is enforcing rules. The agent will be instructed to adjust the client-side workflow to create JEs as "draft" first, then post.
Void/Reverse & Button Behavior (Your Issues #7 new list & #4 new list): These are important for usability and correctness and are on the list for the agent.
Accruals & Intercompany (Your Issue #2 new list): As discussed, these are valuable features for later phases, as outlined in Instructions.md. We need to ensure the core JE CRUD, posting, and attachment functionalities are rock-solid first.
I will now provide very specific, prioritized instructions to the Replit Agent, focusing first and foremost on resolving the initial authentication and entity loading.

Guidance for Replit Agent:

Agent, the Creator/Owner's latest feedback and console logs show that User Issue #1 (Initial Authentication & Entity/Client Data Loading) is still the primary blocker. Despite your previous changes to AuthContext.tsx and EntityContext.tsx, the console logs clearly show repeated 401 Unauthorized errors for /api/entities at startup and that entities/clients are not reliably populating the selectors without a page reload. Also, newly added entities require a reload.

This is your ONLY task until it is demonstrably fixed and confirmed by me with logs.

Task 1: (CRITICAL BLOCKER) Fix Authentication & Initial/Dynamic Entity Data Loading

A. Post-Login Entity Fetching:

Verify AuthContext.tsx Changes: Ensure your previously described changes for queryClient.resetQueries and queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['/api/entities'] }) (and ['/api/clients'] if it's a separate fetch) are correctly placed immediately after setUser(userData.user) in the login function and are being awaited if they are async. Add/confirm the ARCHITECT_DEBUG_AUTH_CTX logs I specified.
Verify EntityContext.tsx Query:
The useQuery for ['/api/entities']: Confirm the enabled option is strictly !!user && !isAuthLoadingFromAuthContext. Add/confirm the ARCHITECT_DEBUG_ENTITY_CTX_QUERY_CONFIG log.
Inside the queryFn: Add console.log('ARCHITECT_DEBUG_ENTITY_CTX_FETCH_ATTEMPT: Fetching /api/entities. User from useAuth():', user);. If user is null here despite enabled being true (or evaluating to true), there's a state timing issue between AuthContext and EntityContext.
Ensure credentials: 'include' is on the Workspace call.
In onSuccess or data processing: Log the raw entitiesData length and the state after setAllEntities and setInitialLoadComplete(true). initialLoadComplete should only be true if the fetch was a 200 OK and entitiesData is valid.
Error Handling for Entity Query: In the onError handler of the useQuery for ['/api/entities'] in EntityContext.tsx, log the error in detail: console.error('ARCHITECT_DEBUG_ENTITY_CTX_QUERY_ERROR: Error fetching entities:', error);. We need to see if the 401s are being caught here and if they prevent initialLoadComplete from being set to true.
B. Entities Not Showing After Client Selection / Adding New Entity (User Issue #1):

GlobalContextSelector.tsx / EntitySelector.tsx: When a client is selected, how are entities filtered from allEntities in EntityContext? Log allEntities available at the point of filtering, the selectedClientId, and the resulting filtered list. If allEntities is empty or stale, the selector won't update.
Creating a New Entity: The mutation used to create a new entity (e.g., in EntityAddModal.tsx or its hook) MUST invalidate the ['/api/entities'] query in its onSuccess handler:
TypeScript

// In the mutation options for adding an entity
onSuccess: () => {
  console.log('ARCHITECT_DEBUG_NEW_ENTITY_SUCCESS: Invalidating [/api/entities] query.');
  queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['/api/entities'] });
}
This will ensure EntityContext re-fetches the list of all entities, including the new one, and then GlobalContextSelector can display it.
C. Verification & Logging:

Perform a clean login (admin/admin123).
Provide complete console logs showing the ARCHITECT_DEBUG_ traces from application start, through login, to client selection, and entity selection. We must see that /api/entities is called successfully (200 OK) after login and invalidation, and that the selectors populate without a page reload.
Then, add a new entity and confirm (with logs) that the entity list/selector updates without a page reload due to the query invalidation.
Do not work on any other issues until this entire authentication -> client selection -> entity display -> new entity creation -> entity display flow is stable and verified with logs. The stability of the rest of the application depends critically on this foundation.
