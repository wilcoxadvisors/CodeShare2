✅ Explicit Instructions for Cleanup & Verification
Step 1: Verify and Clean Import Statements

Explicitly open and inspect each of these files:

client/src/App.tsx

client/src/features/journal-entries/pages/JournalEntries.tsx

client/src/features/journal-entries/pages/NewJournalEntry.tsx

client/src/features/journal-entries/components/BatchJournalUpload.tsx

client/src/features/journal-entries/components/JournalEntryForm.tsx

For each file, explicitly:

Remove any outdated or incorrect imports (e.g., imports referencing ../components/, ../pages/, or old directories).

Ensure all imports correctly reference the new features/journal-entries/... paths only.

Explicitly confirm that all imports are correctly pointing to the new, consolidated location (client/src/features/journal-entries/...).

Step 2: Verify and Clean the index.ts file

Explicitly open:
client/src/features/journal-entries/index.ts

Clearly verify:

The file only exports currently used and existing components/pages/hooks.

Remove explicitly any exports pointing to old or non-existing files/components.

Ensure the export names explicitly match their default exports (confirm consistency).

Step 3: Comprehensive Code Cleanup

Explicitly run the tool ts-prune or an equivalent to identify:

Unused imports

Unused exports

Unused components or logic

Explicitly remove any unused code identified by this tool from:

client/src/features/journal-entries/...

Any other file flagged as having unused imports or components related to the journal entries functionality.

Clearly remove any commented-out code or legacy logic fragments still present in the journal entries files listed above.

Step 4: Restart and Verify Application

Restart the development application explicitly.

Clearly verify:

The application starts without any runtime errors or console warnings.

The Journal Entries, New Journal Entry, and Batch Upload pages load correctly and function without errors.

Step 5: Explicit Confirmation of Task Completion
Once you've explicitly performed the above steps, please provide a concise summary clearly stating:

✅ Confirmation that imports are now fully cleaned and correctly reference the new feature structure.

✅ Confirmation that the index.ts file is accurately reflecting the current, cleaned structure.

✅ Confirmation that unused imports, exports, and code fragments have been removed explicitly.

✅ Confirmation that the application is running without runtime errors or console warnings.
