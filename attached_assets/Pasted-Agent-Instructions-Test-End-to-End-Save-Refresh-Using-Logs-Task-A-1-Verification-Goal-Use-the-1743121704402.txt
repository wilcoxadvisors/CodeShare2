Agent Instructions: Test End-to-End Save & Refresh Using Logs (Task A.1 Verification)

Goal: Use the detailed logging you just added (Checkpoint f2280a10) to verify the entire sequence: successful API saves in SetupStepper, followed by the onComplete call, triggering handleSetupComplete in Dashboard, leading to query invalidation and UI refresh.

Context: You have added extensive "DEBUG:" logs to SetupStepper.tsx's handleCompleteSetup and Dashboard.tsx's handleSetupComplete functions. Now we need to execute the flow and analyze these logs.

Steps:

Execute Full Test Flow (No Edits/Updates):
Action: Ensure the application is running the latest code (after Checkpoint f2280a10).
Action: Go through the setup flow (Steps 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> Finish).
Action: In Step 2, add one or two entities but do NOT attempt to update or edit them.
Action: Click "Finish & Add Client" in Step 3.
Collect Logs and Observe Results:
Action: Carefully observe the Frontend Browser Console. Copy ALL "DEBUG:" log messages that appear during and immediately after clicking "Finish". Pay attention to the sequence:
Logs from SetupStepper showing API call payloads, statuses, responses.
The log DEBUG SetupStepper: API saves successful. Calling props.onComplete()...
Logs from Dashboard like DEBUG Dashboard: handleSetupComplete triggered. Invalidating queries... and DEBUG Dashboard: Attempting refetchDashboard...
Action: Check the Browser Network Tab:
Did POST /api/admin/clients succeed (Status 200/201)?
Did POST /api/admin/entities succeed for all added entities (Status 200/201)?
Was a request made to refetch the dashboard data (e.g., GET /api/admin/dashboard or /api/admin/clients) after the saves completed? Did it succeed?
Action: Observe the UI:
Did the setup modal close automatically?
Did the client list on the dashboard update to show the new client?
Report Detailed Findings:
Action: Provide the complete sequence of "DEBUG:" logs copied from the console.
Action: Report the final HTTP status codes from the Network tab for the client save, entity save(s), and dashboard data refetch requests.
Action: State clearly whether the modal closed and whether the dashboard UI updated correctly.
Action: Note any console errors that occurred during this process.
