Task: Implement Chart of Accounts UI Button Functionality (REITERATION)

Goal: Implement the necessary frontend logic, primarily using TanStack Query mutations, to ensure the Add, Edit, and Delete account buttons are fully functional on the client/src/pages/ChartOfAccounts.tsx page. Also, verify the Import/Export buttons are connected.

Implement Add/Edit Account Mutations:
Action: Open client/src/pages/ChartOfAccounts.tsx and the related form component (likely AccountForm.tsx).
Action: Define and implement the TanStack Query mutations using useMutation:
useAddAccount: Configure this mutation to make a POST request to the correct backend endpoint (likely /api/clients/:clientId/accounts) with the new account data payload.
useUpdateAccount: Configure this mutation to make a PUT request to the correct backend endpoint (likely /api/clients/:clientId/accounts/:accountId) with the updated account data.
Action: Ensure the form's onSubmit handler correctly calls either addAccountMutation.mutate(...) or updateAccountMutation.mutate(...) based on whether it's adding or editing.
Action: Implement onSuccess callbacks within both mutations to invalidate the relevant queries using queryClient.invalidateQueries for keys like ['accounts', clientId] and ['accounts', 'tree', clientId]. This ensures the UI refreshes after successful operations.
Implement Delete Account Mutation:
Action: Locate the delete button handler in ChartOfAccounts.tsx.
Action: Ensure an <AlertDialog> or similar confirmation step is present before deleting.
Action: Define and implement the useDeleteAccount mutation:
Configure useMutation to make a DELETE request to the correct backend endpoint (likely /api/clients/:clientId/accounts/:accountId).
Action: Ensure the confirmation dialog's "confirm" action calls deleteAccountMutation.mutate(accountId).
Action: Implement an onSuccess callback for this mutation to invalidate queries as described above.
Verify Import/Export Buttons:
Action: Briefly check the "Import", "Export CSV", and "Export Excel" buttons.
Action: Confirm their onClick handlers correctly point to the existing handler functions (handleImport..., handleExportCsv, handleExportToExcel).
Report Completion:
Action: Report specifically that the useAddAccount, useUpdateAccount, and useDeleteAccount mutations have now been implemented and integrated into the component and form logic. Confirm the Import/Export buttons are connected.
