Agent Instructions: Fix Database Save, Industry Display, Back Navigation State Loss
Goal: Resolve the three specific bugs reported by the user after Checkpoint b1f302ef.

Phase 1: Fix Database Save & Dashboard Update (Bug 3 - Highest Priority)

Focus: SetupStepper.tsx (handleCompleteSetup), Backend (server/adminRoutes.ts, server/storage.ts), Dashboard.tsx.
Hypothesis: The API calls in handleCompleteSetup (added around dbb44cec) are failing, the backend endpoints are incorrect, or the dashboard refresh logic is flawed.
Action (Frontend API Call Debugging):
Review handleCompleteSetup in SetupStepper.tsx:
Add detailed logging before the Workspace('/api/admin/clients', ...) call: Log the exact clientData payload.
Add logging after the client fetch: Log response.status AND await response.json(). Check the returned client ID.
Add logging before the setupEntities.map(...) loop: Log the setupEntities array and the newClientId.
Inside the map loop: Log the entityPayload for each entity fetch.
After Promise.all(): Log the success/failure. Log any caught errors specifically.
Before props.onComplete(): Log that the API calls seem successful.
Action (Backend Verification - CRITICAL):
Instruct the agent to re-verify the backend code:
Check server/adminRoutes.ts: Are POST /api/admin/clients and POST /api/admin/entities routes definitely present and correctly defined using app.post(...)? Log the req.body received in both route handlers.
Check server/storage.ts: Do createClient and createEntity methods correctly use Drizzle (db.insert(...).returning())? Log the data being inserted and the result from the DB call. Are errors handled?
Action (Dashboard Refresh Verification):
In Dashboard.tsx: Confirm the queryKey in queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['clients'] }) exactly matches the useQuery key for the client list. Log just before calling invalidateQueries.
Test & Report:
Complete the setup flow.
Check Frontend Logs, Backend Logs, Network Tab (Status codes? Responses? Errors?).
Check Dashboard UI.
Report: Clearly state if data successfully reaches the backend, gets saved (check backend logs/DB directly if possible), and if the dashboard UI updates. Provide specific logs/errors.
Phase 2: Fix Industry Display (Bug 1) (AFTER Phase 1 Verified)

Focus: EntityManagementCard.tsx (form submit, getEntityIndustryLabel), SetupSummaryCard.tsx.
Action: Debug getEntityIndustryLabel function: Log the input industryValue, the INDUSTRY_OPTIONS array used for lookup, and the returned label. Is the logic correct for mapping values like "tech" to "Technology" and "other" to "Other"?
Action: Verify UI components call getEntityIndustryLabel(entity.industry) and log the entity.industry value being passed.
Test & Report: Add entities with different industries. Check logs & UI display in Steps 2 & 3. Confirm correct labels appear.
Phase 3: Fix State Loss on Back Navigation (Bug 2) (AFTER Phase 1 & 2 Verified)

Focus: SetupStepper.tsx (handleBack function, setupEntities state, localStorage usage if any remains).
Action: Add logs in handleBack showing activeStep before/after. Add logs in EntityManagementCard (on render) showing props.entities.
Action: Ensure no state variables (setupEntities, clientData) or localStorage keys are being cleared/reset during the handleBack operation. The state should simply persist in SetupStepper.
Test & Report: Go Steps 1->2->3, add entities, click "Back" to Step 2. Check logs. Does the entity list remain correct? Confirm fix.
