Agent Instructions: Debug Frontend Entity Update Logic (Step 2)

Goal: Identify and fix the error occurring in the UI when saving an edited entity within Step 2 (EntityManagementCard.tsx).

Context: Your automated API test for entity updates passed (Checkpoint da381783), confirming the backend is likely correct. However, the user reported errors when updating via the UI. The problem must be in the frontend component's interaction with the API or its state management. Logging was added previously (Checkpoint 44faa52d).

Relevant Files:

client/src/components/setup/EntityManagementCard.tsx (Handles editing form, onSubmit, updateEntityMutation)
client/src/components/setup/SetupStepper.tsx (Manages setupEntities state, receives update callbacks)
Debugging Steps:

Verify/Review Frontend Update Code & Logging:
Action: Open client/src/components/setup/EntityManagementCard.tsx.
Action: Ensure the detailed "DEBUG:" logging added in Checkpoint 44faa52d is still present and active within:
The onSubmit function (before calling updateEntityMutation.mutate, logging the entityId and payload).
The updateEntityMutation's onSuccess and onError handlers.
Action: Meticulously review the logic again: How is the entityId determined for the update? How is the payload constructed? How is the state update handled in onSuccess (e.g., calling props.onEntityUpdated)?
Simulate UI Test & Capture Logs:
Action: Authenticate as admin (admin/password123).
Action: Simulate the exact failing sequence: Go to Dashboard -> Add Client -> Step 1 -> Step 2 -> Add a new entity -> Click "Edit" on that entity -> Change a field -> Click "Save Changes".
Action: Collect ALL relevant Frontend Console Logs (DEBUG messages showing payload creation, mutation calls, success/error handlers). Note the specific error message. Check the Network Tab for the PUT request status and response.
Analyze Logs & Identify Frontend Failure:
Action: Analyze the logs collected in Step 2. Where does the process fail in the frontend sequence?
Is the correct entityId being passed? (Entities added during setup might not have a real DB ID yet - is this handled correctly for updates?)
Is the payload correct?
Does the mutation trigger the onError handler? What is the error?
Does the onSuccess handler execute but fail later when updating state?
Report: State the specific point of failure identified in the frontend logic based on the logs. Provide the relevant log snippets.
Implement Frontend Fix:
Action: Implement the fix in EntityManagementCard.tsx or potentially in how SetupStepper.tsx handles the update callback, based on the diagnosis from Step 3.
Verify Fix:
Action: Repeat the simulation test from Step 2.
Action: Confirm the entity update now works correctly without errors, and the change is reflected in the Step 2 list. Report success.
Let the agent proceed with Step 1 (verifying logging) and Step 2 (simulating the failing UI action and capturing logs).
