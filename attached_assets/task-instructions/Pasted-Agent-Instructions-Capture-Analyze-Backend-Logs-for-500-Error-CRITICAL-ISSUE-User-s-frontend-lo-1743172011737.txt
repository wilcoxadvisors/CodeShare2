Agent Instructions: Capture & Analyze Backend Logs for 500 Error

CRITICAL ISSUE: User's frontend logs confirm a 500 Internal Server Error occurs when updating an entity in Step 2 after navigating Step 3 -> Step 2. You must capture the backend logs during this failure.

Goal: Use the detailed backend logging already in place to diagnose the cause of the 500 error in the PUT /api/admin/entities/:entityId request handler or the storage.updateEntity method when triggered by the specific user scenario.

Relevant Files:

server/adminRoutes.ts (Contains the PUT /api/admin/entities/:entityId route handler with logging)
server/storage.ts (Contains the updateEntity database logic with logging)
Debugging Steps:

Authenticate & Reproduce Error:
Action: Authenticate programmatically (admin / password123).
Action: Simulate the exact failing UI flow: Dashboard -> Add Client -> Step 1 -> Step 2 -> Add two entities -> Step 3 -> Back to Step 2 -> Edit one entity -> Click "Save Changes".
Action: Monitor the Backend Console closely during the "Save Changes" action that triggers the PUT request and results in the 500 error.
Capture & Analyze Backend Logs:
Action: Copy ALL logs from the Backend Console that appear during the failing PUT request.
Action: Look specifically for the "DEBUG:" logs within the route handler and storage.updateEntity.
Action: Pinpoint where the execution stops or the specific error message (from Node.js, Drizzle, DB driver, etc.) that is logged just before the 500 response is sent.
Report Findings:
Action: Provide the specific backend error message.
Action: Include the sequence of relevant "DEBUG:" logs from the backend console leading up to the error.
Implement Backend Fix:
Action: Based on the specific backend error identified, implement the fix in server/adminRoutes.ts or server/storage.ts.
Verify Fix:
Action: Restart the application.
Action: Repeat the exact test simulation (Authenticate -> Setup Flow including Back navigation -> Add Entity -> Edit Entity -> Save Changes).
Action: Confirm the PUT request now succeeds (Status 200 OK) without backend errors. Check backend logs. Report success.
The backend logs are essential to understand why the server is failing in this specific navigation context.
