Task Assignment: Perform UI Verification for CoA Display Fix (Agent Task)

Context:
The code to accountCode refactoring is complete, and the seeding script was run (checkpoint 7f216055 / 01e50dcf). The TypeScript check (tsc) timed out but was bypassed due to suspected external type issues. The agent attempted login via curl but did not complete the essential UI verification for the CoA display.

Goal:
Verify that the original "CoA data not displaying" bug is resolved by having the agent simulate UI interaction to check the Chart of Accounts page for both a newly created client and an existing client.

Instructions:

Part 1: Verify New Client CoA Display

Action: Ensure Application is Running:

Verify the application is running (npm run dev). Restart if necessary.
Action: Create New Client via UI Simulation:

Using available browser/UI simulation tools (NOT curl), simulate the full "Add Client" workflow:
Log in as admin (admin@example.com / admin123).
Navigate to the Dashboard.
Click "Add Client".
Complete all steps in SetupStepper.tsx to create a new test client.
Record the ID of the newly created client.
Action: Verify New Client CoA in UI:

After successfully creating the new client, simulate navigating to the Chart of Accounts page for this new client ID.
Observe & Record: Does the standard Chart of Accounts data (with accountCode) display correctly in the UI for this newly created client? Describe the observed UI state or capture evidence (e.g., screenshot using available tools).
Part 2: Verify Existing Client CoA Display

Action: Verify Existing Client CoA in UI:
Simulate navigating to the Chart of Accounts page for an existing client (e.g., Client ID 1). Ensure you are still logged in as admin.
Observe & Record: Does the Chart of Accounts data (which existed previously) now display correctly in the UI for this existing client, showing accountCode? Describe the observed UI state or capture evidence.
Verification:

Confirm CoA data is visible and correct in the UI for the newly created client.
Confirm CoA data is visible and correct in the UI for the existing client.
Reporting:

Report PASS/FAIL for the New Client UI Verification (Step 3), including the new Client ID and evidence/description/screenshot.
Report PASS/FAIL for the Existing Client UI Verification (Step 4), including evidence/description/screenshot.
Note the status of the tsc --noEmit check (still timing out, likely due to external types, but code appears functional).
If both UI verifications pass, explicitly state that the original "CoA data not displaying" bug appears resolved and Task B.1 (Chart of Accounts) can be considered fully complete (pending resolution of the tsc timeout issue at a later time if necessary).
