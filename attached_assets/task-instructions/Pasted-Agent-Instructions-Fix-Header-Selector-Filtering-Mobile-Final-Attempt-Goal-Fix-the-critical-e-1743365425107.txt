Agent Instructions: Fix Header Selector Filtering & Mobile (Final Attempt)

Goal: Fix the critical entity filtering bug in GlobalContextSelector. Address the mobile performance/usability issue. Verify correct context setting for entities.

Relevant Files:

client/src/components/dashboard/GlobalContextSelector.tsx (Primary focus)
client/src/components/Header.tsx (Mobile layout)
Implementation Steps:

Fix Entity Filtering Logic (CRITICAL - AGAIN):

Action: Open client/src/components/dashboard/GlobalContextSelector.tsx.
Action: Go to the section inside the clients.map(client => ...) loop where entity CommandItems are supposed to be rendered only if the client is expanded (expandedClients[client.id]).
Action: FIND THE FILTERING BUG. Add these specific logs immediately before trying to render the entity items for an expanded client:
JavaScript

console.log(`DEBUG: Rendering entities for Client <span class="math-inline">\{client\.id\} \(</span>{client.name}). Expanded: ${!!expandedClients[client.id]}`);
console.log(`DEBUG: Full entities list length: ${entities?.length}`);
const clientEntities = Array.isArray(entities) ? entities.filter(e => e.clientId === client.id) : [];
console.log(`DEBUG: Filtered list for Client ${client.id}. Length: ${clientEntities.length}`, clientEntities.map(e => e.id)); 
Action: Ensure that the subsequent .map() call to render entity CommandItems uses the clientEntities variable derived from the filter. If the logs show filtering isn't reducing the list, the filter condition e => e.clientId === client.id or the entities variable itself must be incorrect. Fix it.
Verify Entity Context Update (onSelect):

Action: Re-confirm the onSelect handler for Entity CommandItems sets BOTH setSelectedClientId(entity.clientId) AND setCurrentEntity(entity). Add logs if needed. console.log('Entity selected, setting context:', entity);
Address Mobile Performance/Usability:

Action: Once filtering (Step 1) is confirmed working via logs, the number of rendered items should decrease drastically, potentially improving performance.
Action: Review Header.tsx again. Ensure the mobile trigger (e.g., <Button variant="outline" size="icon"> <Menu /> </Button>) is simple and correctly toggles the same Popover that the desktop trigger uses. Ensure the PopoverContent / CommandList has max-height and overflow-y-auto styles applied [cite: Previous plan].
Verification:

Action: Restart the application. Report build success.
Action: Describe test steps focusing on the fixes:
Check console logs: Do they prove filtering works when expanding a client?
UI Test: Expand a client. Does the list visually show only entities for that client?
Context Test: Select an entity. Check console logs for onSelect. Does the header button text update correctly? Can pages needing currentEntity (like JE) now potentially access it? (Verify basic access, full JE functionality is later).
Mobile Test: Does the mobile trigger open the selector? Does it feel more responsive now that filtering might be working?
