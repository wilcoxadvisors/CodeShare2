Task: Execute Manual CoA Import/Export Test Procedure (Confirmed)

Goal: Execute the manual test procedure to verify the Chart of Accounts Import (CSV & Excel) and Export (CSV) functionality works correctly, including the recently added data integrity checks.

1. Prerequisites:
* Action: Ensure you are logged in as admin.
* Action: Navigate to the Chart of Accounts page (/chart-of-accounts).
* Action: Select the client "OK" (or "Pepper", "ONE1") using the global context selector. Confirm the initial state shows the standard seeded CoA (74 accounts).

2. Test Export CSV:
* Action: Click the "Export CSV" button.
* Observe & Report: Was the CSV download initiated successfully? (Report yes/no). (User confirmed this was working after the last fix, but perform the action again as part of the full flow).

3. Test Import Valid CSV:
* Action: Click the "Import" button.
* Action: Select the test/coa-import-export/valid_import.csv file.
* Action: Confirm the import.
* Observe & Report:
* Did a success notification appear? What did it say (report details about created/updated/skipped counts)?
* Did the UI update correctly? Does it now show the accounts from the CSV file?
* Does the hierarchy look correct in the UI based on the ParentAccountNumber in the CSV?

4. Test Import Valid Excel:
* Action: Reset the client's CoA to the standard seeded state (e.g., re-run the seeding script scripts/seed-existing-clients-coa.ts for the specific client ID). Confirm the reset.
* Action: Click "Import", select test/coa-import-export/valid_import.xlsx, and confirm.
* Observe & Report: Report the same points as for the valid CSV test (success notification details? UI update correct? Hierarchy correct?).

5. Test Import Invalid CSV:
* Action: Reset the client's CoA to the standard seeded state. Confirm the reset.
* Action: Click "Import", select test/coa-import-export/invalid_import.csv, and confirm.
* Observe & Report:
* Did an error notification appear? What was the approximate error message?
* Did the CoA data in the UI remain unchanged compared to the state before attempting the invalid import?
