Task: Debug CoA UI Button Execution Flow with Logging

Goal: Add console logging to the relevant handlers and mutations in client/src/pages/ChartOfAccounts.tsx to understand why the Add, Edit, and Delete actions might be failing for the user.

Add Logging to Event Handlers:
Action: Open client/src/pages/ChartOfAccounts.tsx.
Action: Add a console.log("DEBUG: [HandlerName] called"); statement at the very beginning of the following functions:
handleNewAccount (called by Add Account button)
handleEditAccount (called by Edit button on a row)
handleDeleteClick (called by Delete button on a row)
handleDeleteConfirm (called by the confirmation dialog's Delete button)
handleSubmit (called when saving the Add/Edit form)
Add Logging to Mutations:
Action: Locate the definitions for useAddAccount, useUpdateAccount, and useDeleteAccount (likely within ChartOfAccounts.tsx or potentially imported hooks).
Action: Add logging within each mutation's configuration:
Inside the mutationFn (or equivalent logic making the API call), add: console.log("DEBUG: [MutationName] - Mutate called with:", variables); (replace [MutationName] appropriately, log the input variables).
Inside the onSuccess callback, add: console.log("DEBUG: [MutationName] - onSuccess triggered");
Inside the onError callback, add: console.log("DEBUG: [MutationName] - onError triggered:", error);
Test Actions and Report Logs:
Action: Restart the application (Restart Start application).
Action: Simulate the Add Account flow: Click "Add Account", enter minimal valid data into the form dialog, click the "Save/Create" button.
Report: Provide the exact sequence of "DEBUG: ..." logs that appear in the browser console for the Add Account action.
Action: Simulate the Edit Account flow: Click the "Edit" action on an existing account row, change a field (e.g., Description), click the "Save/Update" button.
Report: Provide the exact sequence of "DEBUG: ..." logs that appear in the browser console for the Edit Account action.
Action: Simulate the Delete Account flow: Click the "Delete" action on an existing account row, click the "Delete" button in the confirmation dialog.
Report: Provide the exact sequence of "DEBUG: ..." logs that appear in the browser console for the Delete Account action.
