What the log is telling you — and why it’s not an error
Log line	Meaning	OK?
api/auth/me … 401 (Unauthorized)	When the SPA first boots it pings /api/auth/me to see if there’s an existing cookie / session. You hadn’t logged-in yet, so the backend quite correctly returned 401.	✅ expected
🔑 Attempting login with username: admin
🔐 Login successful, user: Object	You submitted the login form, the backend replied with the user object, and the AuthContext stored it. Your cookie is now set.	✅ good
Entities data updated – received 52 entities	Right after the login the front-end fetched /api/clients/:clientId/entities and put 52 entities into context.	✅ good

So the authentication round-trip is healthy.
Now we need to prove that the new hierarchical routes are wired correctly.

Quick sanity-check of the new routes
Pick any client / entity in your UI sidebar.
(e.g. client 251, entity 392 from your sample data)

Manually hit the JE list URL in the browser bar:

bash
Copy
Edit
http://localhost:5173/clients/251/entities/392/journal-entries
Expected results:

What you should see	If instead you get
• JE table loads
• Total 52 entities logged
• No red “404” in console	404 → one of the <Route> paths is wrong
Blank table → entity context didn’t pick up the URL params

Click any row → should land on

bash
Copy
Edit
/clients/251/entities/392/journal-entries/123   (example id)
Click Edit → should land on

bash
Copy
Edit
/clients/251/entities/392/journal-entries/123/edit
If you do hit a 404
Open App.tsx and re-check the exact strings:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<Route path="clients/:clientId/entities/:entityId/*" element={<EntityLayout />}>
  <Route path="journal-entries"            element={<JournalEntries />} />
  <Route path="journal-entries/:id"        element={<JournalEntryDetail />} />
  <Route path="journal-entries/:id/edit"   element={<JournalEntryForm editMode />} />
  <Route path="journal-entries/:id/delete" element={<DeleteJournalEntry />} />
</Route>
Make sure every old “plain” route was deleted:

tsx
Copy
Edit
{/* ❌ REMOVE these if they’re still here */}
// <Route path="/journal-entries" … />
// <Route path="/journal-entries/:id" … />
Verify you really wrapped the app in <BrowserRouter> in main.tsx.

If the table is blank (but no 404)
That means the EntityContext never saw the URL params.

Check that EntityContext’s useEffect is watching both clientId and entityId (strings) and converting them to numbers when it compares to entities.

Call console.log(clientId, entityId, entities.length) at the top of your EntityLayout to prove the values are arriving.

Still stuck?
Send me:

App.tsx – the <Routes> block only

The full URL that shows blank/404

The console output after you navigate to that URL (just like you pasted above
