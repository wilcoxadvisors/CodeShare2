üö© Root cause identified:
You are encountering a scenario where existing attached files (already uploaded to the server) are being treated as "pending files" in the frontend. When you attempt to delete an existing attachment, the UI mistakenly triggers removal from a "pending uploads" list instead of actually invoking the delete API endpoint.

‚úÖ Exact Fix Required:
Your frontend code explicitly needs clear separation between:

Pending Files: Files newly added (not yet uploaded to the backend).

Existing Files: Files already uploaded and persisted on the server.

‚öôÔ∏è Critical Fix (Explicit steps):
1. Explicitly distinguish pending files from existing files:
Make sure you have two separate arrays clearly named, e.g.:

typescript
Copy
Edit
const [pendingFiles, setPendingFiles] = useState<File[]>([]);
const [existingFiles, setExistingFiles] = useState<ExistingFileType[]>([]);
Ensure the ExistingFileType explicitly includes identifiers from the backend (such as id and fileName).

2. Correct Deletion Logic for Existing Files:
When deleting an existing file, explicitly call the backend's delete API:

typescript
Copy
Edit
const deleteExistingFile = async (fileId: number) => {
  await axios.delete(`/api/clients/${clientId}/entities/${entityId}/journal-entries/${entryId}/files/${fileId}`);
  
  // Explicitly refresh existing files after deletion
  queryClient.invalidateQueries(["journalEntryFiles", entryId]);
};
Use this explicitly for existing attachments:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<Button
  onClick={() => deleteExistingFile(file.id)}
  disabled={isFileDeletionDisabled || deleteFileMutation.isPending}
>
  Delete
</Button>
3. Correct Logic for Pending Files:
When deleting pending files explicitly:

typescript
Copy
Edit
const removePendingFile = (fileName: string) => {
  setPendingFiles(pendingFiles.filter(f => f.name !== fileName));
};
For pending uploads explicitly:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<Button
  onClick={() => removePendingFile(file.name)}
  disabled={deleteFileMutation.isPending}
>
  Remove
</Button>
üö® Why your current logic explicitly fails:
Right now, you have one logic mistakenly applied to both pending and existing files. Thus, your current logic explicitly prints:

"File remove from pending upload" when trying to delete an existing attachment.

üöß Explicitly Corrected File Management Logic Example:
Here is a clear, explicit example:

jsx
Copy
Edit
{existingFiles.map(file => (
  <div key={file.id}>
    <span>{file.fileName}</span>
    <Button
      onClick={() => deleteExistingFile(file.id)}
      disabled={isFileDeletionDisabled || deleteFileMutation.isPending}
    >
      Delete
    </Button>
  </div>
))}

{pendingFiles.map(file => (
  <div key={file.name}>
    <span>{file.name}</span>
    <Button
      onClick={() => removePendingFile(file.name)}
      disabled={deleteFileMutation.isPending}
    >
      Remove
    </Button>
  </div>
))}
üìå Immediate Next Steps:
Explicitly implement this clear separation logic:

Existing file deletion:
API call (axios.delete)

Pending file deletion:
Local removal (setPendingFiles)

Then explicitly test:

Ensure deletion of existing attachments calls your API.

Ensure deletion of pending files only updates the frontend.

This will explicitly solve your confusion and file-deletion issues.
