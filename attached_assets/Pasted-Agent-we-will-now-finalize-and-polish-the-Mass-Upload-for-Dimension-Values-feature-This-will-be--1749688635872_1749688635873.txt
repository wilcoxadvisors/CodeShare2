Agent, we will now finalize and polish the "Mass Upload for Dimension Values" feature. This will be a two-part process: first, we will test the existing upload functionality, and second, we will add the user-friendly template download.

Part 1: End-to-End Verification
Goal: Confirm that the existing implementation for uploading a CSV file works as expected.

Create a Test File: Manually create a simple CSV file named test_values.csv with the following content:
Code snippet

code,name,description
TEST01,Test Value 1,This is the first test value.
TEST02,Test Value 2,This is the second test value.
Execute Test:
Navigate to the Manage > Dimensions page.
Click "Manage Values" on any dimension card (e.g., "Department").
In the dialog, switch to the "Bulk Upload" tab.
Upload the test_values.csv file.
Verify Results:
Confirm that a success message appears, indicating 2 new values were created.
Switch back to the "Individual" tab and confirm that "Test Value 1" and "Test Value 2" are now present in the list.
Part 2: Implement Template Download
Goal: Create a "Download Template" feature that provides users with a pre-populated CSV of all existing values for that dimension.

Sub-Part 2a: Backend API Endpoint

File to Modify: server/routes/dimensionRoutes.ts
Action: Create a new GET endpoint: /api/dimensions/:dimensionId/values/csv-template.
Endpoint Logic:
Fetch all existing dimension values for the given dimensionId from the database.
Use the papaparse library's "unparse" function to convert the array of value objects into a CSV formatted string. The headers should be code, name, and description.
Set the response headers for a file download:
TypeScript

res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/csv');
res.setHeader('Content-Disposition', 'attachment; filename="dimension_values_template.csv"');
Send the generated CSV string as the response with a 200 status.
Sub-Part 2b: Frontend Download Button

File to Modify: client/src/features/manage/BulkDimensionValueUpload.tsx
Action: Add a "Download Template" <Button> or link to the UI.
Functionality:
When the user clicks this button, it should make a GET request to the new /api/dimensions/:dimensionId/values/csv-template endpoint.
The frontend must handle the text/csv response and trigger a file download in the browser. This is typically done by creating a Blob from the response text and then generating a temporary URL for an <a> tag, which is then programmatically clicked.
Agent, please begin with Part 1: testing the existing functionality. After confirming it works, proceed to Part 2, starting with the backend endpoint.
