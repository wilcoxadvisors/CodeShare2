Architect's Instruction for the Replit AI Agent
Agent, the user has confirmed a new direction. We will now refactor the bulk management feature to be centralized on the Dimensions page. This will be a multi-step process.

Phase 1: UI Refactoring & Cleanup
Goal: Remove the old, incorrect UI to make way for the new, centralized workflow.

File to Modify: client/src/pages/manage/DimensionsPage.tsx

Action: In the "Bulk Upload Dimension Values" card at the top of the page, delete the <Select> dropdown menu that asks the user to choose a dimension. The card should be simplified to only contain the "Download Template" and "Upload File" controls.
File to Modify: client/src/features/manage/DimensionValuesManager.tsx

Action: Delete the "Bulk Upload" tab and its corresponding TabsContent from this component. This dialog will no longer have any bulk functionality and will only be used for managing individual values. You can also remove the Tabs component wrapper if it's no longer needed.
Phase 2: Implement "Master Template" Functionality
(To be performed after the UI cleanup in Phase 1 is complete)

Goal: Create a new backend endpoint and wire up the UI to download a single template for all dimensions.

Create New Backend Endpoint:

File: server/routes/dimensionRoutes.ts
Action: Create a new GET endpoint: /api/clients/:clientId/master-values-template.
Logic: This endpoint must: a. Fetch all dimensions for the given clientId. b. For each of those dimensions, fetch all of its values. c. Generate a single list of value objects. Each object in this list must include a new property, dimension_code, that holds the code of the parent dimension. d. Use papaparse to convert this comprehensive list into a single CSV string. The headers must be: dimension_code, value_code, value_name, value_description. e. Set the proper headers and send the CSV as the response.
Update Frontend Logic:

File: client/src/pages/manage/DimensionsPage.tsx
Action: Wire the "Download Template" button's onClick handler to call this new /api/clients/:clientId/master-values-template endpoint. The existing download mechanism can be adapted for this.
Agent, please begin with Phase 1: The UI Cleanup. Confirm when the old UI elements have been removed.
