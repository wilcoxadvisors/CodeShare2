Below is a second insert-only patch that weaves the remaining Sage-Intacct-inspired capabilities you enumerated (AI GL, Copilot, AP/AR Automation, Dashboards, Data Flows, Fixed Assets, Project/Resource Mgmt, Forms, Multi-Entity Cons, Security) into the roadmap—again without deleting or rewriting anything that is already there.

As before, copy-paste each block verbatim into the indicated spot.
