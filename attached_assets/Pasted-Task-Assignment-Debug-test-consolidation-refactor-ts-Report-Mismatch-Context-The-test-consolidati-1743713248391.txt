Task Assignment: Debug test-consolidation-refactor.ts Report Mismatch

Context: The test-consolidation-refactor.ts script revealed that calling the generateConsolidatedReport method via the old storage object (which delegates) produces different results than calling the method directly on the consolidationStorage object, even with fixed dates.

Goal: Identify the specific differences in the report outputs and diagnose the root cause of the discrepancy in the refactored code or the test setup.

Instructions:

Action: Enhance Test Output (test/test-consolidation-refactor.ts):

Open CodeShare/test/test-consolidation-refactor.ts.
Modify the comparison part of the test. Instead of just checking for inequality, print both report objects (or key sections of them) to the console for detailed comparison when a mismatch is detected. Use JSON.stringify(reportObject, null, 2) for readability.
TypeScript

// Example modification in the test script:
if (JSON.stringify(report1) !== JSON.stringify(report2)) {
    console.error("Consolidated reports do not match!");
    console.log("--- Report 1 (via storage delegation) ---");
    console.log(JSON.stringify(report1, null, 2));
    console.log("--- Report 2 (via direct consolidationStorage) ---");
    console.log(JSON.stringify(report2, null, 2));
    // Optionally compare specific critical sections first:
    // console.log("Report 1 Totals:", report1.totalAssets, report1.totalRevenue); // Adjust based on report type
    // console.log("Report 2 Totals:", report2.totalAssets, report2.totalRevenue);
    throw new Error("Consolidated reports differ.");
} else {
    console.log("Consolidated reports match successfully!");
}
Ensure the test generates the same report type (e.g., Balance Sheet) with the same parameters (group ID, dates) for both calls (storage.generateConsolidatedReport and consolidationStorage.generateConsolidatedReport).
Action: Re-run Test and Analyze Differences:

Execute the test script: cd test && npx tsx test-consolidation-refactor.ts.
Carefully examine the printed outputs for report1 and report2 when the test fails.
Identify the specific fields, accounts, or values that are different between the two reports. Are totals different? Are certain accounts present in one but not the other? Are balances calculated differently?
Action: Investigate Calculation Logic:

Based on the specific differences found in Step 2, investigate the relevant calculation logic within the consolidation helper methods (e.g., consolidateBalanceSheets, consolidateIncomeStatements, etc.) inside CodeShare/server/storage/consolidationStorage.ts.
Also, review the generateConsolidatedReport method itself in consolidationStorage.ts.
Look for potential causes like:
Floating-point precision issues in sums.
Differences in how accounts/entities are filtered or fetched.
Subtle differences in how data is aggregated or mapped.
Ensure that the methods called within generateConsolidatedReport (like generateBalanceSheet, etc.) are consistently using the correct underlying data fetching methods (which should now primarily reside within consolidationStorage or be imported from other specific storage modules if necessary, not calling back to the old monolithic storage object).
Action: Apply Fix:

Based on the investigation, modify the code in CodeShare/server/storage/consolidationStorage.ts (or potentially the test setup if the issue lies there) to resolve the discrepancy.
Action: Re-run Test for Verification:

Execute the test script again: cd test && npx tsx test-consolidation-refactor.ts.
Confirm the test now passes and the reports match.
Verification:

The root cause of the report mismatch is identified.
The relevant code in consolidationStorage.ts or test-consolidation-refactor.ts is fixed.
The test-consolidation-refactor.ts script runs successfully, confirming both call paths produce identical reports.
Reporting:

Report the specific differences found between report1 and report2.
Explain the root cause identified.
Describe the fix applied.
Report the final PASS/FAIL status for the test-consolidation-refactor.ts execution after the fix.
