Great progress so far ‚Äî you‚Äôve knocked out the biggest blockers (hierarchical JE routes, URL-helper imports, and query invalidation logic).
Before we call the File-Attachment bug officially closed, walk through the checklist below; it catches the last few ‚Äúgotchas‚Äù that usually surface after a route-shape refactor.

üîÑ Quick-turn Validation Checklist
Step	What to Verify	Tips / Commands
1. Back-end route parity	POST /api/clients/:cId/entities/:eId/journal-entries/:jeId/files and GET /‚Ä¶/files, DELETE /‚Ä¶/files/:fileId all hit the same controller you already use for the legacy path.	Server ‚Üí grep -R "attachment.controller" server/routes ‚Äî be sure the new route file is registered in server/routes.ts before the legacy one to avoid shadowing.
2. Controller param mapping	Controller expects req.params.jeId & req.params.entityId. If you used Express‚Äôs mergeParams: true, you‚Äôre good; otherwise add it.	```ts
router = express.Router({ mergeParams: true });

| **3. Front-end helpers** | Confirm **urlHelpers.ts** has: ```ts
export const getJournalEntryFilesBaseUrl = (cId,eId,jeId)=>
 `/api/clients/${cId}/entities/${eId}/journal-entries/${jeId}/files`;
``` | Search in the uploader component for any leftover `"/api/entities"` strings. |
| **4. React-Query cache keys** | After upload/delete, `invalidateJournalEntryQueries()` should also call: ```ts
queryClient.invalidateQueries([getJournalEntryFilesBaseUrl(cId,eId,jeId)]);
``` | Keeps the file list fresh without a page reload. |
| **5. File payload & headers** | In `apiRequest`, ensure multipart posts pass the `FormData` directly **without** `JSON.stringify` and *don‚Äôt* set `Content-Type` (the browser does it). | ```ts
fetch(url,{ method:"POST", body: formData, headers: authHeaders })``` |
| **6. Cypress smoke** | ‚úî Upload two PDFs, ‚úî refresh page, ‚úî delete one, ‚úî download the other ‚áí file should open. | `cypress/e2e/journalEntryFile.spec.cy.ts` |
| **7. Error fallbacks** | 404 from wrong JE ID should surface toast ‚ÄúEntry not found‚Äù (now that html pages won‚Äôt slip through). | Throw `response.statusText` from `apiRequest` if `!response.ok`. |
| **8. Clean logs** | `yarn dev` then run the Cypress spec. Server and browser consoles should be clean of 404/500s and React-Query warnings. |

When that list is ‚úÖ green, the attachment flow is solid.

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next micro-tasks (after the bug is green)

1. **Unit test for the new route**  
   *server/tests/attachmentRoutes.test.ts* ‚Äî hit POST/GET/DELETE on the hierarchical path.

2. **Delete the deprecated `/api/entities/:id/journal-entries/:jeId/files` route**  
   Guard it with `410 Gone` for one sprint, then purge.

3. **Dimensions framework (Task B.2.1)**  
   You‚Äôre now unblocked to branch `feat/dimensions-mvp` and start on the `dimensions` & `dimension_values` tables + admin CRUD UI.

Let me know once you run through the checklist (or if anything red-flags) and we‚Äôll move straight
