Checklist PDF explicitly downloads immediately.

Submitted data explicitly saves correctly to the database (checklistSubmissions table).

‚úÖ 2. Verify Explicitly the Database Record
Explicitly query the database after submission:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM checklistSubmissions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
Explicitly confirm the latest form submission data matches the data submitted from your test.

‚úÖ 3. Verify Explicitly Mobile Responsiveness
Explicitly test the "Free Financial Checklist" form on multiple mobile screen sizes.

Explicitly confirm form fields and buttons scale correctly.

Explicitly adjust the CSS or React component styles if necessary.

‚úÖ 4. Verify Explicitly the Email Sending Process
