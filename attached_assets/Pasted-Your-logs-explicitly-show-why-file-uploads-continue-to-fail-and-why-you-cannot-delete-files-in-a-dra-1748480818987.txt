Your logs explicitly show why file uploads continue to fail and why you cannot delete files in a draft entry:

🚩 Critical issues explicitly identified:
Issue 1: Uploading Files – Incorrect FormData

Your debug logging clearly indicates the FormData issue:

yaml
Copy
Edit
ARCHITECT_DEBUG_UPLOAD_XHR_SENDING: FormData contents before sending:
ARCHITECT_DEBUG_UPLOAD_XHR_SENDING: Files count in FormData: 1
  - File 0: undefined 50400 undefined
This explicitly indicates:

The file name is undefined.

The file type is undefined.

Only the file size (50400) is explicitly provided.

The backend explicitly rejects this malformed request:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Failed to upload pending files to entry: Error 400: No files were uploaded
Issue 2: Deletion of attachments – Incorrect condition logic

Your changes attempted this explicitly:

typescript
Copy
Edit
const isAttachmentsDisabled =
  journalEntry &&
  !["draft", "pending_approval"].includes((journalEntry as { status?: string })?.status || "");
  
const isFileDeletionDisabled = 
  journalEntry &&
  !["draft", "pending_approval"].includes((journalEntry as { status?: string })?.status || "");
However, explicitly checking, both variables have identical logic and thus offer no improvement. The deletion logic is explicitly not effective.

🛠️ Explicit Code Fixes Required
✅ Fix for Issue 1: Correctly formulating FormData
The explicit correct way to form the file attachments is this:

In uploadPendingFilesToEntry function explicitly ensure:

typescript
Copy
Edit
const formData = new FormData();

pendingFiles.forEach(file => {
  // explicitly ensure "files" is the correct backend field
  formData.append("files", file, file.name);
});
CRITICAL FIX:
Your current code doesn't explicitly pass the filename. The correct explicit method is:

typescript
Copy
Edit
formData.append("files", file, file.name);
This explicitly ensures the file name, type, and data are passed correctly, solving the undefined issue.

✅ Fix for Issue 2: File Deletion Logic Correction
The deletion should explicitly be allowed only when entries are draft or pending_approval. Implement explicitly as follows:

typescript
Copy
Edit
const canModifyAttachments = journalEntry?.status === "draft" || journalEntry?.status === "pending_approval";

// Explicitly set disable condition correctly
const isAttachmentsDisabled = !canModifyAttachments;

// Explicitly set file deletion logic
const isFileDeletionDisabled = !canModifyAttachments;
Then explicitly use this condition:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<Button
  disabled={deleteFileMutation.isPending || isFileDeletionDisabled}
>
✅ Preventing File Duplication (Explicit Recommendation)
After successful upload, explicitly clear pending files to avoid duplication:

typescript
Copy
Edit
if (uploadPendingFilesRef.current) {
  await uploadPendingFilesRef.current(entryId);
  setPendingFiles([]); // explicitly clear pending files
}
🚨 Explicit Code Implementation Recap (Critical to explicitly implement now):
1. Explicitly correct FormData upload:

typescript
Copy
Edit
pendingFiles.forEach(file => {
  formData.append("files", file, file.name); // explicit fix
});
2. Explicitly correct file deletion logic:

typescript
Copy
Edit
const canModifyAttachments = ["draft", "pending_approval"].includes(journalEntry?.status || "");

const isAttachmentsDisabled = !canModifyAttachments;
const isFileDeletionDisabled = !canModifyAttachments;
Use this explicitly to conditionally disable buttons correctly.

3. Explicitly clear pending files on successful upload explicitly:

typescript
Copy
Edit
await uploadPendingFilesRef.current(entryId);
setPendingFiles([]); // explicit clear
✅ Explicit Immediate Next Step for Verification:
Explicitly apply these corrections explicitly as listed above.

Explicitly retest the file upload:

Verify console logs explicitly show correct filenames and data.

Explicitly retest file deletion in draft mode:

Ensure buttons are enabled explicitly.

Explicitly confirm files delete without errors.

These corrections will explicitly resolve the current critical problems clearly shown in your logs.
