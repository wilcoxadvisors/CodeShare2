Explicit Next Steps for Immediate Resolution:
Perform these steps exactly to resolve the storage initialization issue:

âœ… Step-by-Step Guide:
Verify Database Storage Initialization:

Confirm in server.ts or your main entry point that storage is initialized like:

typescript
Copy
Edit
import { DatabaseStorage } from './storage';
const storage = new DatabaseStorage(/* database connection params */);
app.locals.storage = storage;
Ensure Middleware Consistency:

Check that app.locals.storage initialization occurs before any route registration in your main Express app file (server.ts or app.ts).

Check Verification Route Registration:

In your main routes file (routes.ts), verify:

typescript
Copy
Edit
import { registerVerificationRoutes } from './routes/verificationRoutes';

export function registerRoutes(app: Express) {
  // Verify storage is accessible at this point
  if (!app.locals.storage) {
    throw new Error("Storage not initialized before route registration");
  }

  // Pass storage explicitly if necessary
  registerVerificationRoutes(app, app.locals.storage);
}
Update Verification Routes Handler:

Modify the verification route handler definition to explicitly accept storage instance:

typescript
Copy
Edit
// verificationRoutes.ts
import { Router, Express } from 'express';
import { IStorage } from '../storage';

export function registerVerificationRoutes(app: Express, storage: IStorage) {
  const router = Router();

  router.get('/api/clients', async (req, res) => {
    const clients = await storage.clients.getClients();
    res.json(clients);
  });

  router.get('/api/entities', async (req, res) => {
    const entities = await storage.entities.getEntities();
    res.json(entities);
  });

  // Ensure routes are correctly mounted
  app.use(router);
}
Restart Server and Re-run Verification Script:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run start
cd verification-scripts
node complete-form-verification.js
Verify the Issue is Resolved:

Check the output and ensure no 500 errors occur and that storage methods properly return client and entity data.
