Task: Debug and Fix CoA Import Logic in server/storage.ts (REITERATION)

Review importCoaForClient Logic:
Action: Open server/storage.ts.
Action: Conduct a thorough review of the entire importCoaForClient function.
Focus Areas to Re-check Carefully:
Case Sensitivity: Ensure mapping from CSV headers (like CODE, ParentCODE, Type, issubledger from your test file) to database fields is consistently handled case-insensitively. Verify the correct usage and effectiveness of any helper functions (normalizeCsvHeaders, getCaseInsensitiveValue, etc.).
Parent Account Resolution: Double-check the two-pass logic for setting parentId. How does it handle a ParentAccountNumber from the CSV that doesn't match any account number created in the first pass? Is this causing errors or unexpected behavior?
Data Integrity Logic: Re-verify the complex logic for handling existing accounts (those matched by AccountNumber). Are accounts with transactions correctly identified? Are only permitted fields updated? Is inactivation working as intended?
Transaction Scope: Confirm absolutely that the entire operation (clearing old accounts, inserting new accounts, updating parent IDs, handling existing accounts) is wrapped within a single db.transaction. If any error occurs at any stage (validation, DB write), does the transaction fully roll back?
Error Handling: Review how validation errors (e.g., duplicate account number in the file, invalid account type, missing required field, unresolved parent) and database errors are caught and reported. Are the error messages clear enough to diagnose import problems?
Efficiency: Could any part of the logic be causing the timeouts observed, especially related to database lookups within loops? (e.g., the accountHasTransactions check).
Implement Fixes:
Action: Based on this review, implement the necessary corrections within the importCoaForClient function in server/storage.ts. Prioritize correctness and robustness.
