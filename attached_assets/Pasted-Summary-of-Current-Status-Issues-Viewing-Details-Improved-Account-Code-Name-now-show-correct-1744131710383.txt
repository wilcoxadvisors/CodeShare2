Summary of Current Status & Issues:

Viewing Details:
Improved: Account Code + Name now show correctly in the lines on the detail page (Good!).
Still Broken: Other essential details (like Reference, Entity Code in lines, Line Description, possibly header fields) are missing from the detail view (JournalEntryDetail.tsx).
Editing:
Broken (Routing): Clicking the 'Edit' button still leads to a 404 page. The route definition added in App.tsx isn't being correctly targeted or the link is wrong.
Broken (Data Loading): When/if you could get to the edit form, it resets instead of loading the data of the JE being edited.
Broken (Saving): The 'Reference' field doesn't save. It's unclear if any edits would save correctly given the form reset issue and potential problems with the PUT request handler.
Workflow Actions:
Broken ('Save as Draft'): This button (if present on the edit/create form) apparently does nothing. It should save the current state without changing the status (using POST for new, PUT for existing drafts).
Broken ('Post Journal Entry'): This button label is wrong for creating/editing drafts. The action itself also seems incorrect, as the logs show it's still trying to submit with status: "posted" which is likely invalid for initial creation/saving drafts. This needs to be fixed to submit as status: "draft".
Broken ('Submit for Approval'): This button (expected on the detail page for 'draft' entries) doesn't work.
What to Tell the Agent:

"Okay, the account code/name display in the detail lines is fixed, thank you. However, several core issues remain with editing and the workflow:

Incomplete Detail View: The JournalEntryDetail.tsx page still needs to display all relevant fields. Please ensure the Reference Number, Status, Date, Line Description, and Entity Code (for each line) are rendered correctly based on the fetched data.

Reference Field: The 'Reference' number entered in the form is not being saved. Please check both the JournalEntryForm's submission logic and the backend API (POST /api/journal-entries, PUT /api/journal-entries/:id) to ensure this field is correctly sent and saved.

Edit Functionality:

Routing: The 'Edit' button still causes a 404. Please verify the link generated by the button in JournalEntryDetail.tsx exactly matches the /journal-entries/:id/edit route defined in App.tsx.
Data Loading: The JournalEntryForm needs logic added so that when it's loaded via the /edit route, it fetches the JE data using the ID from the URL and pre-fills the form fields.
Workflow Buttons & Logic: This needs significant correction:

Form Buttons:
The button currently labeled 'Post Journal Entry' on the form is incorrect. It should be 'Save as Draft'.
This 'Save as Draft' button must trigger the correct API call: POST /api/journal-entries with status: 'draft' when creating, OR PUT /api/journal-entries/:id (keeping status: 'draft') when editing an existing draft. Crucially, stop sending status: 'posted' from the form submission.
Ensure the 'Save as Draft' button actually triggers the API call (it currently does nothing according to user feedback).
Detail Page Buttons: Implement the 'Submit for Approval', 'Approve', and 'Post' buttons on the JournalEntryDetail.tsx page. They should only appear based on the JE's status and user permissions, and they need to trigger the correct backend API calls (POST .../request-approval, POST .../approve, POST .../post)."
Alignment with Instructions.md:

These fixes are essential for completing Phase B.2 (GL/JE functionality).
Correcting the workflow buttons and ensuring data saves/loads correctly are fundamental to usability and align with the "easy-to-use" and "customer-focused" design goals.
Implementing the correct status transitions (draft -> request-approval -> approved -> posted) is key to the accounting logic and Automation Goals.
