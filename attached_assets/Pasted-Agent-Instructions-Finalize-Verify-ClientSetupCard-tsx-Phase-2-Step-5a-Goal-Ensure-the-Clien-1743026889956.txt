Agent Instructions: Finalize & Verify ClientSetupCard.tsx (Phase 2, Step 5a)

Goal: Ensure the ClientSetupCard.tsx component (Step 1 of the 3-step setup flow) correctly captures client information, passes data to the parent stepper component, and triggers the transition to the next step upon successful validation/submission.

Relevant Files:

client/src/components/setup/ClientSetupCard.tsx
client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx (or SetupStepper.tsx - wherever the setup flow state/handlers like setActiveStep, setClientData reside)
shared/validation.ts (Client validation schema, e.g., clientSetupSchema)
Steps:

Review ClientSetupCard.tsx Implementation:
Action: Open client/src/components/setup/ClientSetupCard.tsx.
Verify:
Form Fields: Does the form contain the correct fields for initial client setup (e.g., Company Name, Contact Name)? Are fields correctly marked as optional or required based on needs (user previously mentioned email might not be required)?
Validation: Does the form use react-hook-form and the appropriate Zod schema (e.g., clientSetupSchema from shared/validation.ts) for client-side validation?
Data Handling: Does the onSubmit handler correctly capture the validated form data?
Verify Data Passing & Navigation:
Action: Examine how data and navigation are handled upon successful form submission.
Verify:
Data Passing: Is the captured client data correctly passed up to the parent component (Dashboard.tsx or SetupStepper.tsx)? This is likely done via a prop function like setClientData(formData) which should be called within the onSubmit handler before navigation.
Navigation: Is the onNext function prop (passed down from the parent) called correctly after validation succeeds and data is passed up?
Does calling onNext successfully trigger the parent component to update the state (e.g., setActiveStep(1))?
Test the Flow (Simulated):
Action: Simulate the user interaction:
Open the "Add Client" modal/dialog (Step 1: ClientSetupCard should display).
Fill the form with valid data.
Submit the form.
Analyze:
Does client-side validation pass?
Is the setClientData function (or similar) called in the parent with the correct form data?
Is the onNext function called?
Does the UI transition to show Step 2 (EntityManagementCard)?
Report: Confirm that Step 1 (ClientSetupCard) functions correctly â€“ validates input, passes client data up to the parent component, and successfully triggers the navigation to Step 2. Report any errors or discrepancies found.
