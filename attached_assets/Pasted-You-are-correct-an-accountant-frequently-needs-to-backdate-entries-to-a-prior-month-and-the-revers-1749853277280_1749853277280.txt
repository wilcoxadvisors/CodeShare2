You are correct; an accountant frequently needs to backdate entries to a prior month, and the reversal date must be relative to the entry's date, not the current date. The current implementation is flawed.

The rule should be: The reversal date can be any date, past or future, as long as it comes after the date of the journal entry itself.

I will instruct the agent to correct this logic immediately.

Architect's Instruction for the Replit AI Agent
Status Review: The user has correctly identified a major flaw in the business logic for the Accrual Reversal feature. The date picker incorrectly prevents selecting a reversal date that is in the past relative to the current system date.

New Requirement: The validation logic must be changed. A reversal date is valid as long as it occurs after the date of the original journal entry.

Current Task: Fix the date picker validation logic in the frontend.

File to Modify: client/src/features/journal-entries/components/JournalEntryForm.tsx

Action: You will locate the <Calendar> component within the "Auto-Reversing Accrual" section and replace its flawed disabled prop with the correct business logic.

Step 1: Locate the Calendar Component

In client/src/features/journal-entries/components/JournalEntryForm.tsx, find the <Calendar> component that is shown when the isAccrual switch is active.
Step 2: Replace the disabled Prop Logic

Find the disabled prop on the <Calendar> component.

Delete the existing logic inside the prop.

Replace it with the following new logic. This implementation correctly compares the selectable date against the date entered in the journal entry (journalData.date).

TypeScript

disabled={(date) => {
  // If no journal entry date is set yet, don't disable anything.
  if (!journalData.date) return false;

  // Create a clean date object from the journal entry date string to avoid timezone issues.
  // The journalData.date is 'YYYY-MM-DD'. Adding 'T00:00:00' makes the comparison reliable.
  const entryDate = new Date(`${journalData.date}T00:00:00`);

  // Disable all dates that are on or before the journal entry's date.
  return date <= entryDate;
}}
Agent, this is a critical logic fix. Please implement it now.
