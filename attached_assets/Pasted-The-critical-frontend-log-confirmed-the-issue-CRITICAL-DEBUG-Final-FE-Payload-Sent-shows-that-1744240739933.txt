The critical frontend log confirmed the issue: CRITICAL DEBUG: Final FE Payload Sent: ... shows that accountCode and type are still being included in the payload sent to the PUT API, even when only the name was changed by the user. This is causing the backend's correct validation to fail the request with a 400 error.

Task: Fix the payload construction logic in client/src/pages/ChartOfAccounts.tsx.

Locate Payload Logic: Go to the handleSubmit function (or equivalent saving function) within client/src/pages/ChartOfAccounts.tsx. Find the section that builds the final data object (finalUpdateData, payloadBeingSentToMutate, etc.) to be sent to updateAccount.mutateAsync.
Implement Correct Filtering: Modify this logic. It needs to compare the current accountData (from the form state) with the originalAccountData (fetched when the edit dialog opened). It should create a new object containing only the fields where the form value is different from the original value.
Ensure Exclusion: Double-check that this filtering logic guarantees that accountCode and type are never included in the final payload object sent to the API if the accountHasTransactions state is true (since these fields should also be disabled in the UI in that case).
Remove Conflicting Logic: Ensure any previous attempts to fix this that might conflict (like spreading all fields and then trying to overwrite or remove) are cleaned up, leaving only the correct "send changed fields only" logic.
Example Logic Sketch (Conceptual):

TypeScript

// Inside handleSubmit, after validation checks
const changedFields = {};
const original = originalAccountData; // Assume original data is available
const current = accountData; // Current form state

// Compare fields and add only changed ones to payload
Object.keys(current).forEach(key => {
  if (current[key] !== original[key]) {
     // Special check: If accountHasTransactions, do NOT add accountCode or type even if they somehow appear different
     if (accountHasTransactions && (key === 'accountCode' || key === 'type')) {
        // Skip adding restricted fields if transactions exist
     } else {
        changedFields[key] = current[key];
     }
  }
});

// Ensure essential IDs are present if needed by API/hook, but ONLY changed data otherwise
const payload = {
  // Maybe ID is needed? Check useUpdateAccount hook needs
  // id: accountId,
  // clientId: clientId,
  ...changedFields
};

console.log('CRITICAL DEBUG: Final FE Payload Sent:', JSON.stringify(payload, null, 2));
updateAccount.mutateAsync({ /* Pass necessary IDs and the filtered payload */ });

Report: Confirm that the logic has been updated to strictly send only modified fields (excluding accountCode and type if accountHasTransactions is true). Then, ask the user to test updating only the name of account 7962 again.
