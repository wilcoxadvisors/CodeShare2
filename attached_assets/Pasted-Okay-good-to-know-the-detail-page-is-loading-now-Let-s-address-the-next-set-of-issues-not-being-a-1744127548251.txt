Okay, good to know the detail page is loading now. Let's address the next set of issues: not being able to edit/approve/post, and the incomplete display of details.

1. Cannot Edit / Approve / Post Journal Entries:

Problem: You're seeing the JE details, but the buttons or functionality to change its status (Edit draft, Approve, Post) are missing or not working.
Likely Causes:
Missing UI Elements: The action buttons (Edit, Approve, Post, Void, etc.) might simply not be implemented yet in the JournalEntryDetail.tsx component.
Conditional Rendering/Disabling: If the buttons exist, they might be incorrectly hidden or disabled based on the current JE status (draft in this case) or the user's role/permissions.
Missing Frontend Logic: The functions (useMutation hooks, likely in useJournalEntry.ts or directly in the detail page) needed to call the backend APIs for these actions might not be implemented or connected to the buttons.
Backend API Endpoints: The corresponding backend API endpoints (PUT /api/entities/:entityId/journal-entries/:id for editing, POST .../:id/approve, POST .../:id/post mentioned in README-journal-api-improvements.md) might be missing, incomplete, or have bugs in server/journalEntryRoutes.ts.
What to Tell the Agent: "Now that I can see the JE details, I need the workflow actions. Please check the JournalEntryDetail.tsx page:
Are the 'Edit', 'Approve', and 'Post' buttons displayed correctly based on the entry's status (e.g., 'Edit' only for 'draft') and user permissions?
Are these buttons correctly wired up to trigger the corresponding API calls (PUT for update, POST for status changes like approve/post)?
Are the backend API routes (PUT /api/entities/:entityId/journal-entries/:id, POST .../:id/approve, POST .../:id/post, etc.) fully implemented and working correctly in server/journalEntryRoutes.ts?"
2. UI/UX Doesn't Display All Details:

Problem: The JournalEntryDetail.tsx page is loading but isn't showing all the expected information for the journal entry (e.g., header fields like date, reference, status, totals, or maybe line details).
Likely Cause: The rendering part of the JournalEntryDetail.tsx component is likely incomplete. While the agent fixed the data fetching and handling different line formats, they might not have added the JSX code to actually display all the fields from the journalEntry object that is being successfully fetched (as shown by the DEBUG - JournalEntryDetail - Using journalEntry: Object logs).
What to Tell the Agent: "The JE detail page loads data, but it's not displaying all the necessary information. Please review the JSX rendering section of client/src/features/journal-entries/pages/JournalEntryDetail.tsx and ensure it displays:
Header Fields: Date, Description, Reference Number, Status, Journal Type, Created By/At, etc.
Line Items Table: Make sure the table clearly shows Account Code & Name, Entity Code, Line Description, Debit Amount, and Credit Amount for each line.
Totals: Display the calculated Total Debits and Total Credits, and potentially the Entity Balances summary if relevant."
Alignment with Instructions.md:

Implementing the Edit/Approve/Post actions is crucial for completing the Core Accounting Module (Phase B).
Displaying all details clearly and providing workflow actions directly relates to the goals of being "customer-focused," "easy-to-use," and having a "great design."
This again highlights the need for thorough testing (Phase G) to catch these functional gaps.
Focus the agent on implementing the missing action buttons/API calls and ensuring the JournalEntryDetail.tsx component renders all the fetched data fields completely.
