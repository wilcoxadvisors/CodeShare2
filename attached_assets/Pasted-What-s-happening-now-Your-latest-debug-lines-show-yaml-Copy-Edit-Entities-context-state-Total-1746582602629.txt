What’s happening now
Your latest debug lines show:

Entities context state:
  - Total entities: 49         ✅ API is returning data
  - Filtered entities: 0       ❌ because selectedClientId = null
  - Initial loading complete: true
JournalRedirector: Waiting for initial data load…
So:

Initial fetch is finished (initialLoadingComplete = true).

JournalRedirector still thinks it has to “wait” because its guard is tied to the wrong flag (or the flag isn’t being passed through the hook).

selectedClientId is null, therefore entities is an empty array.

That means the redirector never reaches the branch that shows the No-Entity-Selected placeholder.

Fix in three steps
Step	File	What to change
1	EntityContext.tsx	Make sure you actually export isInitialLoading (or initialLoadingComplete) and that the context type matches the value object.

ts\nexport const EntityContext = createContext<EntityContextType>({\n …,\n isInitialLoading: true,\n});\n\n// inside Provider value\nvalue={{\n entities,\n allEntities,\n currentEntity,\n selectedClientId,\n setSelectedClientId,\n isInitialLoading,\n}}\n
2	useEntity() hook	Ensure it returns that new field:
const ctx = useContext(EntityContext);
3	JournalRedirector.tsx	Use the correct flag and branch:

tsx\nconst { entities, isInitialLoading } = useEntity();\n\n// 1. wait only for first load\nif (isInitialLoading) {\n return <Spinner/>; // or nothing\n}\n// 2. nothing selected yet –> show placeholder\nif (!entities.length) {\n return <NoEntitySelected/>; // component you created\n}\n// 3. entity present –> navigate or render list\nreturn <Outlet/>; // or your list component\n

Key point: after isInitialLoading flips to false, you must not keep the redirector in a “waiting” state even if entities is empty.

Restart dev server!
Hot-refresh keeps complaining
"EntityContext export is incompatible" — that means consumers still hold the old shape.
Stop Vite, restart npm run dev, then hard-reload the browser to clear stale modules.

Minimal sanity test
Fresh reload → /journal-entries
Spinner → then placeholder “Select a client / entity”.

Pick a client/entity from the header selector.
JE list page renders.

Switch back to /journal-entries manually → placeholder appears again.

Add a Cypress spec for that flow so the regression can’t recur.

Let me know once you wire the flag through—if the placeholder still doesn’t appear, share the updated EntityContext and redirector snippets and we’ll pinpoint the mismatch.
