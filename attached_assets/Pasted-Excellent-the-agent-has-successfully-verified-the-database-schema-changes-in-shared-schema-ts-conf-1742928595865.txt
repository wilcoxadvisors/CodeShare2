Excellent, the agent has successfully verified the database schema changes in shared/schema.ts, confirming that entity_ids is removed and the consolidationGroupEntities junction table is correctly defined. This completes the first part of Step 1.

However, Step 1 ("Finalize Data Migration & Cleanup") includes a few more crucial tasks before we can move on to Step 2 ("Strengthen Error Handling & Validation"). The next logical task is to ensure the backend code actually uses this new schema correctly and removes any old logic.

Here are the instructions for the Replit agent for the next part of Step 1:

Objective: Clean up backend logic and API routes to exclusively use the new consolidationGroupEntities junction table and remove all references to the old entity_ids array.

Instructions:

Clean Up Backend Logic (CodeShare/server/consolidation-group-methods.ts):

Carefully review all functions within this file.
Search for and completely remove any code that reads, writes, or references the old entity_ids array property on consolidation group objects.
Verify that all functions managing the relationship between entities and groups (e.g., addEntityToConsolidationGroup, removeEntityFromConsolidationGroup, getConsolidationGroupsForEntity, getEntitiesForConsolidationGroup, etc.) now exclusively interact with the consolidationGroupEntities junction table using Drizzle ORM queries.
Look for and remove any redundant logic that might have been updating both the old array and the new table simultaneously during the migration phase.
Update API Routes (CodeShare/server/consolidationRoutes.ts - check consolidationRoutes.fixed.ts too if it's being used):

Examine all API route handlers related to consolidation groups (e.g., creating groups, adding/removing entities, fetching group details with entities).
Ensure these handlers correctly call the updated, cleaned-up functions from consolidation-group-methods.ts.
Remove any request validation, data manipulation, or response formatting logic within the route handlers themselves that still refers to the old entity_ids array.
