âœ… Progress & Accomplishments (Explicitly Verified)
Verification Routes Created (server/routes/verificationRoutes.ts):

Routes explicitly set up for comprehensive client/entity form field persistence tests.

Explicitly integrated verification routes into main route configuration (server/routes.ts).

Comprehensive Verification Script Created (verification-scripts/complete-form-verification.js):

Explicitly tests the persistence of all client/entity form fields.

Handles login explicitly, manages cookies, and explicitly verifies CRUD operations.

Manual Verification Guide Prepared (docs/FORM_VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md):

Clearly outlines explicit steps for manual verification.

Guides explicit checks for form data persistence, explicitly including save, edit, refresh cycles.

Verification Status Report Template (docs/VERIFICATION_STATUS.md):

Explicitly structured to document detailed outcomes of each verification step.

Setup Script for Test Admin User (verification-scripts/setup-admin.js):

Explicitly automates creation of a test admin account.

Corrected explicitly for response format handling and UserRole enum compliance.

Documentation and Guide Consolidation (docs/README.md):

Consolidates all verification resources explicitly for ease of use.

ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Next Steps
âœ… 1. Execute Comprehensive Form Verification
Explicitly run:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd verification-scripts && node complete-form-verification.js
Explicitly document results in VERIFICATION_STATUS.md.

âœ… 2. Manual Verification (End-to-End)
Explicitly follow FORM_VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md to manually verify:

Client form fields explicitly (creation, editing, refresh persistence).

Entity form fields explicitly (creation, editing, refresh persistence).

Explicit differentiation between "Inactive" (active=false, deletedAt=null) and "Soft-Deleted" (active=false, deletedAt explicitly set).

Explicitly document results clearly:

Pass/fail explicitly.

Clear screenshots for any explicit UI/UX or persistence issue encountered.

âœ… 3. Explicitly Verify and Confirm Completion
After verification explicitly:

Confirm explicitly whether all forms persist data correctly through save/edit/refresh explicitly.

Confirm explicit distinction between inactive entities and soft-deleted entities explicitly functioning as intended.
