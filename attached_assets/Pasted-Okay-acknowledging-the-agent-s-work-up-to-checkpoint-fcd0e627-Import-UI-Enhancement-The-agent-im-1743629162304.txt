Okay, acknowledging the agent's work up to checkpoint fcd0e627:

Import UI Enhancement: The agent implemented changes in ChartOfAccounts.tsx based on your feedback to create a more granular import approval workflow (separate sections for New/Modified/Missing accounts, individual checkboxes, removal of old strategy options).
Bug Fixes: The agent also fixed related JSX and TypeScript errors encountered during the UI implementation.
The next logical step is to verify that this newly implemented enhanced import UI works as designed.

Task Assignment: Verify Enhanced CoA Import UI and Functionality

Context:
Based on user feedback, the Chart of Accounts import preview UI in client/src/pages/ChartOfAccounts.tsx was significantly redesigned (checkpoint fcd0e627) to allow granular approval of additions, modifications, and actions for missing accounts via checkboxes. We need to verify this new UI and its corresponding backend processing work correctly.

Goal:
Verify the enhanced CoA import preview dialog functions as designed: displays changes correctly in sections (New/Modified/Missing), allows individual selection via checkboxes, handles actions for missing accounts, and correctly applies only the selected changes upon submission.

Instructions:

Part 1: Prepare for Test

Action: Confirm Test Files:

Ensure the updated test files are available and contain data that will trigger additions, modifications, and omissions (missing accounts):
test/data/coa-import/updated-tests/test-accounts-import-updated.csv
test/data/coa-import/updated-tests/test-accounts-import-updated.xlsx
Action: Ensure Application is Running & Authenticated:

Verify the application is running (npm run dev).
Simulate logging in as admin (admin / password123).
Part 2: Verify Import Preview Dialog UI & Functionality

Action: Initiate Import & Observe Preview Dialog (CSV):

Use the web application tool to navigate to the CoA page for a test client with existing accounts (e.g., Client ID 1).
Simulate clicking "Import" and uploading the test CSV file (test-accounts-import-updated.csv).
Observe the Preview Dialog:
Confirm the old "Update Strategy" / "Missing Accounts Strategy" radio buttons are gone.
Confirm distinct sections exist for "New Accounts", "Modified Accounts", and "Missing Accounts".
Confirm each listed account change (add, modify, missing) has an individual checkbox next to it.
Confirm "Select All" checkboxes exist for each section and function correctly (selecting/deselecting all items in that section).
For the "Missing Accounts" section:
Is there a selection mechanism (e.g., dropdown) next to each checkbox with options "Mark inactive" and "Delete"?
Is the "Delete" option appropriately disabled if the account cannot be deleted (e.g., has transactions - though this logic might not be fully implemented yet, note if it's always enabled/disabled)?
Capture evidence (screenshots/description) of the preview dialog layout and controls.
Action: Test Selection Logic & Submission (CSV):

Interact with the checkboxes:
Select some but not all new accounts.
Select some but not all modified accounts.
Select different actions ("Mark inactive" / "Delete") for some but not all missing accounts using their checkboxes and action selectors.
Observe the submit button text (e.g., "Apply X selected changes"). Does the count reflect your selections accurately?
Simulate clicking the "Apply Selected Changes" button.
Observe & Report: Did the import process complete successfully via the UI? Note success/error messages.
Action: Verify Backend Data (CSV):

After submission (Step 4), use API calls (GET /api/clients/:clientId/accounts, ensuring you use the correct admin/non-admin route and auth) or direct DB queries to fetch the CoA for the test client.
Verify:
Were only the selected new accounts added?
Were only the selected modified accounts updated (check fields)?
Were only the selected actions (inactive/delete) performed on the missing accounts?
Were unselected items in all categories left untouched?
Report findings clearly.
Action: Repeat for Excel:

Briefly repeat steps 3-5 using the test Excel file (test-accounts-import-updated.xlsx) on a different test client (create one if necessary) to ensure format parity. Focus on confirming the UI appears correctly and submission works.
Verification:

Enhanced preview dialog UI matches the specified design (sections, checkboxes, action selectors, no old strategy radios).
Checkbox selections (individual and "Select All") function correctly.
Submit button accurately reflects the number of selected changes.
Submitting the form applies only the selected changes for adds, modifications, and missing account actions to the backend data.
Both CSV and Excel imports trigger the correct UI and backend processing.
Reporting:

Report PASS/FAIL for the overall Enhanced Import UI verification.
Include descriptions/screenshots of the preview dialog UI.
Detail the results of the selection/submission test (Step 4).
Provide confirmation (e.g., summary of API/DB checks) that the backend data accurately reflects only the selected changes after submission for both CSV (Step 5) and Excel (Step 6) tests.
