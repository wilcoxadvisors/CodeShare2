Agent, the Creator/Owner has provided crucial, direct feedback on the current state of the GlobalContextSelector.tsx and has reiterated a list of outstanding critical bugs.

Selector UX - The Creator/Owner's Current Experience:
"i can select a client and entity now without issue. Just the entities associated with the client do not load right away. I should be able to expand the client and see the entities to chose when needed."

This confirms your last fix resolved the "stuck client" regression â€“ excellent work there, that was a critical P0!
However, the way entities are presented after a client is selected, or when the dropdown is opened, is still not matching the Creator/Owner's expectation. Your last approach ("auto-expand ALL clients") is not the desired interaction.

Task 1: (IMMEDIATE UX FIX) Implement Final Client/Entity Selector Hierarchical Display and Interaction

Objective: Achieve the Creator/Owner's desired UX:

When the selector dropdown is opened, all clients are listed.
Clients are collapsed by default (unless a specific client was previously selected and persisted via localStorage, in which case that client only can be shown as expanded).
Each client has an expand/collapse icon. Clicking this icon shows/hides only that client's list of active entities nested underneath it. Multiple clients can be expanded by the user.
Clicking a Client Name:
Sets selectedClientId.
Sets currentEntity to null (or the first active entity of that client if showEntities is true and we want to maintain auto-entity selection after client selection).
Updates expandedClients to ensure this clicked client is now expanded.
If showEntities={false} (for CoA), the dropdown closes.
Clicking an Entity Name (under an expanded client): Sets currentEntity and its parent selectedClientId. Dropdown closes.
The showEntities={false} prop must correctly hide entity lists and ensure clicking a Client closes the dropdown.
Client/Entity selections must persist via localStorage and be restored on load.
Action - Refine client/src/components/dashboard/GlobalContextSelector.tsx:

Default Expansion: Modify initialExpandedState (useMemo) and any useEffect related to expandedClients.
Ensure that, by default, all clients are rendered collapsed (expandedClients[clientId] = false).
Exception: If a selectedClientId is restored from localStorage, then only that client's entry in expandedClients should be initialized to true.
console.log('ARCHITECT_DEBUG_SELECTOR_INIT_EXPAND: Initializing. Restored ClientID:', restoredSelectedClientId, 'Expanding only this one if present, all others collapsed.');
toggleClientExpansion(clientId): Ensure this function only flips the expansion state of the specified clientId in expandedClients and does not affect other clients.
selectClient(newClientId):
When a user clicks a client name:
Set selectedClientId(newClientId).
Set setCurrentEntity(null) (EntityContext will then auto-select the first active entity for newClientId if showEntities is true).
Update expandedClients to ensure newClientId is expanded: setExpandedClients(prev => ({ ...prev, [newClientId]: true })); (This leaves other user-expanded clients as they are).
If showEntities is false, then setOpen(false).
Rendering: Ensure entities are only rendered under a client if showEntities && expandedClients[client.id].
Active Entities Only: Confirm your filter entities.filter(e => e.clientId === client.id && (e.active === true && e.deletedAt === null)) is correctly applied when displaying entities under an expanded client. (The Creator/Owner confirmed they do not want color indicators for entity status).
Testing & Verification:

Retest all scenarios (Fresh Login, Manual Expansion/Selection, Persistence, CoA Page) I detailed in my immediately preceding message, focusing on the collapsed-by-default behavior and user-controlled expansion.
Crucially, confirm that when on the Chart of Accounts page (where showEntities should be false), the entity section for any selected client is indeed hidden, and selecting a client closes the popover.
Provide ARCHITECT_DEBUG_ logs and a screenshot/GIF of the refined selector in action.

Once the Creator/Owner explicitly confirms this selector UX is exactly as desired, proceed to the following critical functional bugs in strict order:

Task 2: Creating New Journal Entries (Creator/Owner New Issue #4)

Problem: Server correctly rejects creating JEs directly as "posted" with lines. User reports "an entry with no data posts."
Action: Implement the strict two-step (Create Draft then Update to Post) workflow in JournalEntryForm.tsx for new JEs intended for immediate posting. Ensure server validation errors from the initial draft creation are displayed.
Task 3: "Journal ID changing in Edit mode" / Reference Field Stability (Creator/Owner New Issue #3)

Action:
Clarify "Journal ID" with Creator/Owner: Database id or formatted reference "JE-YYYY-####"?
Based on clarification, add detailed logging to trace this identifier.
Review backend reference sequence generation for the "####" part for robustness (>9999 entries/year, uniqueness).
Task 4: Attachment Issues (Bug #7) (Creator/Owner New Issues #2, #3, #5, #6)

Deletion: Network trace for DELETE request & server response.
Upload to Existing JE (400 error): Provide the full JSON error response body.
New Attachments Not Viewable/Removable & Duplicate Attachments: Ensure UI refresh and investigate duplicate upload calls.
Task 5: Void/Reverse JE (Creator/Owner New Issue #7)

Action: Attempt actions, provide network traces, debug client/server logic.
Agent, your focus is Task 1 (Selector UX Finalization). We need the Creator/Owner's green light on this before anything else.
