Review and Feedback for the Agent
You have correctly understood my instructions to pivot to a cron job-based architecture and have successfully completed the refactoring. Your implementation is robust and aligns with best practices for a reliable financial system.

Agent's Performance:

Part 1 (Code Cleanup): Success. You correctly removed the flawed in-memory scheduler from server/queues and server/journalEntryRoutes.ts. This was a critical first step.
Part 2 (Backend Logic): Success. You correctly implemented the new processDueAccrualReversals method in server/storage/journalEntryStorage.ts. The logic to find due entries is sound.
Part 3 (Automatic Posting): Success. You correctly identified the need to modify the existing reverseJournalEntry method and added a postAutomatically flag to handle the requirement for automatic posting. This is excellent and shows a good understanding of code reuse and modification.
Part 4 (Scheduled Task): Success. You correctly created the processReversals.ts script to house the cron job logic. While you initially created a placeholder scheduling function, you correctly integrated the core processing logic into the main task runner in scheduledTasks.ts.
Overall Assessment:
This was an excellent session. You successfully refactored a complex feature from a flawed, non-persistent design to a robust, production-ready architecture. Your debugging of the date/timestamp issues in the SQL queries was also effective.

The Automatic Accrual Reversals feature is now functionally complete on the backend. The final step is to integrate it with the frontend UI.

Architect's Instruction for the Replit AI Agent
Status Update: The backend architecture for handling Automatic Accrual Reversals is now complete and robust.

Next Task: We will now connect the finished frontend UI (Part 2 of the plan) to the backend so that when a user creates an accrual entry, the correct data is saved to the database.

Goal: Ensure that when a user toggles the "Auto-Reversing Accrual" switch and selects a date, the isAccrual and reversalDate fields are correctly saved with the journal entry.

File to Modify: client/src/features/journal-entries/components/JournalEntryForm.tsx

Action: You will verify and, if necessary, correct the data submission logic within the handleSubmit function to ensure the new accrual fields are included in the API request payload.

Step 1: Locate the handleSubmit Function

In client/src/features/journal-entries/components/JournalEntryForm.tsx, find the handleSubmit function.
Step 2: Verify the API Payload

Inside handleSubmit, locate the entryData object that is constructed before being sent to the createEntry or updateEntry mutation.

Verify that this entryData object includes the isAccrual and reversalDate properties, pulled from the component's journalData state. The relevant lines should look like this:

TypeScript

// Inside the entryData object in handleSubmit

const entryData = {
  ...journalData, // This should spread the isAccrual and reversalDate from state
  referenceNumber: fullReference,
  date: journalData.date,
  clientId: resolvedClientId,
  entityId,
  status: initialStatus,
  createdBy: user?.id,
  lines: formattedLines,
};
The agent has previously implemented the UI and the state management, so this data should already be correctly included. This step is a final verification to ensure the data is being passed to the backend.

Step 3: Test the End-to-End Flow

Once verified, the full feature is ready for an end-to-end test.
Test Scenario:
Create a new journal entry.
Toggle the "Auto-Reversing Accrual" switch ON.
Select a date in the future (e.g., tomorrow).
Add line items and ensure the entry is balanced.
Click "Post Entry".
Expected Result:
The entry is created and posted successfully.
In the journal entry list view, the new entry should have a badge indicating it is an "Auto-Reversing" entry with the selected reversal date displayed.
Agent, please perform the verification in Step 2. If the code is correct as expected, you can proceed directly to confirming the feature works with an end-to-end test.
