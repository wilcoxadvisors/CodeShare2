Agent Instructions: Diagnose Backend 500 Error During UI Update Simulation (After Back Nav)

CRITICAL ISSUE: User reported a 500 Internal Server Error when saving an edited entity via the UI in Step 2 specifically after navigating from Step 3 back to Step 2. Your previous API tests did not reproduce this. You MUST simulate this UI flow and capture the backend logs.

Goal: Use the detailed backend logging already in place to diagnose the cause of the 500 error in the PUT /api/admin/entities/:entityId request handler or storage.updateEntity method when triggered by the specific user scenario involving back navigation.

Relevant Files:

server/adminRoutes.ts (Contains the PUT handler with logging)
server/storage.ts (Contains updateEntity logic with logging)
Debugging Steps:

Authenticate & Reproduce Error:
Action: Authenticate programmatically (admin / password123).
Action: Simulate the exact failing UI flow: Dashboard -> Add Client -> Step 1 -> Step 2 -> Add two entities -> Step 3 -> Click "Back" -> Step 2 -> Edit one entity -> Click "Save Changes".
Action: Monitor the Backend Console closely during the "Save Changes" action that triggers the PUT request and results in the 500 error.
Capture & Analyze Backend Logs:
Action: Copy ALL logs from the Backend Console that appear during the failing PUT request.
Action: Look specifically for the "DEBUG:" logs within the route handler and storage.updateEntity.
Action: Pinpoint where the execution stops or the specific error message (from Node.js, Drizzle, DB driver, etc.) that is logged just before the 500 response is sent.
Report Findings:
Action: Provide the specific backend error message.
Action: Include the sequence of relevant "DEBUG:" logs from the backend console leading up to the error.
Implement Backend Fix:
Action: Based on the specific backend error identified, implement the fix in server/adminRoutes.ts or server/storage.ts.
Verify Fix:
Action: Restart the application.
Action: Repeat the exact test simulation (including back navigation) that previously caused the error.
Action: Confirm the PUT request now succeeds (Status 200 OK) without backend errors. Check backend logs. Report success.
