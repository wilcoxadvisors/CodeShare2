You are correct to point that out, and my apologies. The last fix was clearly not sufficient. The agent's log shows it implemented the change, but your experience confirms it didn't solve the root cause of the number formatting issue.

The problem is that the multiple layers of validation (onChange, the if condition in handleLineChange, and the onBlur formatting) are conflicting with each other. We need a single, clear, and robust way to handle decimal input.

Let's replace the faulty logic with a much more direct and reliable method that sanitizes the user's input as they type.

Instructions for Replit AI Agent
Hello Agent. The previous fix for decimal input in the Journal Entry form was not successful. The user is still unable to enter values with cents correctly. We will now implement a more robust solution.

High-Level Goal:

Fix the bug in the Debit and Credit fields so that users can smoothly and correctly type decimal values (e.g., "12.35").

Root Cause Analysis:

The combination of regular expression validation in the handleLineChange function and separate formatting events onBlur is creating unpredictable behavior. The current validation is not correctly handling intermediate user input, leading to decimal points being stripped or misinterpreted.

MANDATORY INSTRUCTIONS: Detailed Code Fix

You must modify the following file:
File: client/src/features/journal-entries/components/JournalEntryForm.tsx

Action:

We are going to completely replace the logic inside the handleLineChange function for the "debit" and "credit" fields. This new logic will be much more reliable.

Locate the handleLineChange function (around line 1558).

Completely replace the code inside the if (field === "debit" || field === "credit") { ... } block.

This is the OLD block of code that you must REMOVE:

TypeScript

// Old code to be removed
if (field === "debit" || field === "credit") {
    if (/^[\d,.]*$/.test(value) && (value.match(/\./g) || []).length <= 1) {
        const updatedLines = [...lines];
        updatedLines[index] = { ...updatedLines[index], [field]: value };
        const numericValue = safeParseAmount(value);
        if (numericValue > 0) {
            const oppositeField = field === "debit" ? "credit" : "debit";
            updatedLines[index][oppositeField] = "";
        }
        setLines(updatedLines);
        const errorKey = `line_${index}_${field}`;
        if (fieldErrors[errorKey]) {
            setFieldErrors((prev) => {
                const updated = { ...prev };
                delete updated[errorKey];
                return updated;
            });
        }
    }
}
This is the NEW, corrected block of code to INSERT in its place:

TypeScript

// New, corrected logic
if (field === "debit" || field === "credit") {
    // This new logic sanitizes the input to ensure it's a valid decimal format.
    // 1. Remove any character that is NOT a digit or a period.
    const sanitizedValue = value.replace(/[^0-9.]/g, '');
    const parts = sanitizedValue.split('.');

    // 2. Ensure only one decimal point is present and limit decimals to 2 places.
    let finalValue = sanitizedValue;
    if (parts.length > 1) {
        const wholePart = parts[0];
        const decimalPart = parts.slice(1).join('').substring(0, 2);
        finalValue = `<span class="math-inline">\{wholePart\}\.</span>{decimalPart}`;
    }

    // 3. Update the state with the cleaned value.
    const updatedLines = [...lines];
    updatedLines[index] = { ...updatedLines[index], [field]: finalValue };

    // 4. Clear the opposite field if necessary.
    if (safeParseAmount(finalValue) > 0) {
        const oppositeField = field === "debit" ? "credit" : "debit";
        updatedLines[index][oppositeField] = "";
    }

    setLines(updatedLines);

    // 5. Clear any errors for this field.
    const errorKey = `line_${index}_${field}`;
    if (fieldErrors[errorKey]) {
        setFieldErrors((prev) => {
            const updated = { ...prev };
            delete updated[errorKey];
            return updated;
        });
    }
}
Explanation of the Fix:

This new logic is much more robust. Instead of just validating, it actively cleans the input at every keystroke to enforce a proper decimal format, preventing errors before they can happen. This should definitively solve the issue.

Verification:

After you apply this change, please test by typing 12.35 into a debit or credit field. The value should appear correctly. Also, test typing invalid characters like abc or multiple decimal points like 12.3.4 to ensure they are handled correctly.
