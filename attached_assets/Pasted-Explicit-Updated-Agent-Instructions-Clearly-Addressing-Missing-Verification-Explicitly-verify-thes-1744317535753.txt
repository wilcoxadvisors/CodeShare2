Explicit Updated Agent Instructions (Clearly Addressing Missing Verification)
Explicitly verify these remaining points:
ðŸš© 2. Immediate Attachment Enablement (Frontend & Backend)
Frontend:

Explicitly create a new journal entry.

Explicitly confirm you can immediately attach files without saving as draft.

Explicitly confirm attachments clearly show a "Pending Upload" status before saving.

Explicitly confirm attachments automatically upload upon initial save.

Backend:

Explicitly confirm backend correctly handles temporary attachments and moves them to permanent storage explicitly upon initial save.

ðŸš© 5. Upload, Download, Delete Attachments (Frontend & Backend)
Explicitly test file uploads, ensure uploads succeed immediately on new and draft entries.

Explicitly test downloads, confirm correct file paths and successful downloads.

Explicitly test file deletions, confirm files delete from storage and database, and UI updates immediately.

ðŸš© 6. Attachment UI/UX Clarity
Explicitly confirm UI dropzone clearly indicates allowed file types (PDF, images, spreadsheets) and maximum file size (10MB).

Explicitly confirm loading spinners appear during file uploads.

Explicitly confirm explicit, clear user-friendly error messages appear on file upload failure.

ðŸš© 7. TypeScript and Type Handling
Explicitly run TypeScript type-check (npm run type-check) and explicitly confirm no errors.

Explicitly verify that JournalEntryFile interface types match backend responses exactly.

ðŸš© 8. Backend Security & Stability
Explicitly verify backend validates file types explicitly and rejects invalid or overly large files explicitly.

Explicitly verify backend explicitly prevents path traversal and injection attacks (e.g., via careful sanitization).

Explicitly verify static file serving is explicitly secure and limited to the correct directory.

ðŸš¨ Provide this Explicit Follow-Up to the Agent:
Agent:
Please explicitly follow these updated instructions precisely. Explicitly confirm each checklist item by testing directly, capturing screenshots, logging outputs, or providing direct code snippets. If any point cannot be explicitly confirmed as working, please clearly state the issue immediately, along with explicit details of the problem encountered.
