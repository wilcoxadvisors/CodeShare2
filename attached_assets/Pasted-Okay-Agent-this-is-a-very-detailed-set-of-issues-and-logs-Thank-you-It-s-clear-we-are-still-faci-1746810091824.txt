Okay, Agent, this is a very detailed set of issues and logs. Thank you. It's clear we are still facing significant hurdles in stabilizing the core functionalities.

Overarching Issue: Authentication & Initial Data Load (User Issue #1)

Before we can reliably debug many of the other problems, we must address the first issue you reported: "Still have to reload after selecting a client. Entities do not show right away in the selector."

The console logs provide strong clues here:

Initial State: DEBUG: Entities context state: ... Total entities: 0 ... Initial loading complete: false ... Loading: true
Auth Failure: api/auth/me:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 (Unauthorized)
Entity Fetch Failure: Repeated api/entities:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 (Unauthorized), even after logs indicate DEBUG: Fetching entities with auth: true.
After Login: Even after üîê Login successful, user: Object, the subsequent EntityContext logs still show Total entities: 0, and GlobalContextSelector.tsx also reports Full entities list length: 0.
This sequence strongly suggests that the initial fetch of entities in EntityContext.tsx is failing due to authentication (401s), or it's not being re-triggered correctly immediately after a successful login. If EntityContext doesn't have the allEntities populated correctly, then GlobalContextSelector cannot filter and display entities for a selected client, and consequently, the Journal Entry list cannot load. The manual reload likely forces a fresh, authenticated fetch which then works.

Action for Agent - Priority #1: Fix Initial Entity Loading & Selector:

EntityContext.tsx - Entity Query enabled state:

Review the useQuery call for fetching /api/entities. Its enabled option must be strictly dependent on a confirmed authenticated user state from AuthContext. For example: enabled: !!user && !isLoadingAuth (where user and isLoadingAuth come from useAuth()). Do not attempt to fetch entities if the user is not yet authenticated or if auth status is still loading.
Log the user object from AuthContext and the enabled status of the entities query just before it fires.
AuthContext.tsx - Post-Login Entity Re-fetch:

When login is successful (e.g., in the onSuccess of your login mutation or after user state is set), you must ensure the entities query is re-fetched or invalidated so EntityContext can get the data with the new authenticated session.
The simplest way is to call queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['/api/entities'] }) from AuthContext immediately after the user state is updated to reflect a successful login. This will tell React Query to mark the entities data as stale and re-fetch.
EntityContext.tsx - State Updates:

Ensure that when the entities data is successfully fetched (after login and query invalidation/re-fetch), the internal state of EntityContext (e.g., allEntities, isLoading, initialLoadComplete) is correctly updated and that this update properly propagates to consuming components like GlobalContextSelector.tsx. The logs show Initial loading complete: true, Loading: false even when Total entities: 0 after login, which might indicate premature state setting or stale data.
GlobalContextSelector.tsx - Reactivity:

Once EntityContext reliably holds allEntities after login, verify that GlobalContextSelector re-renders and that its filtering logic (e.g., DEBUG: Filtered list for Client 73. Length: 0 Array(0)) correctly processes allEntities based on the selectedClientId.
Debugging this specific flow is paramount. Until entities load correctly and are available in the selectors without a page reload after login, debugging downstream issues (JE list, JE posting, attachments) will be compounded by inconsistent or missing prerequisite data.

Regarding the Other User-Reported Issues (To be addressed after Issue #1 is stable):

Issue 2 & 4 (Attachments): "when edit a JE uploading an attachment does not show. But appears to save." AND "Can not remove attachments once added." AND the file upload 400 errors for existing JEs.
We still need the full JSON error response body for the 400 errors during file upload to an existing JE.
For deletion, we need a network trace (request/response) of the DELETE attempt.
Issue 3 (JE ID changes when editing): This needs the specific logging I outlined previously to trace the ID through the edit lifecycle in JournalEntryForm.tsx.
Issue 5 (Posting Error: "Says client ID and entity id required to post je"):
Your latest agent response mentions fixing the postJournalEntry.mutate call to include these. The new logs from the user now show a different error when trying to create and post directly: POST /api/clients/250/entities/393/journal-entries results in a 400 Bad Request with messages like "Reference number \"122\" is already in use..." or "Each entity's debits must equal credits..." or "Cannot add line to journal entry with status posted".
These are server-side validation errors and are actually good in a sense ‚Äì they mean the server is receiving the request and validating the business logic.
"Reference number ... already in use": Your client-side isReferenceDuplicate check should catch this before sending to the server if existingEntries is populated correctly.
"Each entity's debits must equal credits for intercompany transactions": This is a new validation. Ensure your JE lines for intercompany JEs are balanced per entity.
"Cannot add line to journal entry with status posted": If you are creating a JE with status: "posted" in the initial POST request to /api/clients/.../journal-entries, the backend is likely designed to prevent lines from being included in this scenario (expecting a two-step: create draft with lines, then update status to posted). Odoo often works this way. It might be better to always create JEs as 'draft' first, then have a separate action/call to post them. This simplifies the create API.
Issue 7 (Takes a while for an entry to update): Likely client-side cache invalidation.
Issue (from previous list) "not sure if deleting an entry works": The new logs show a DELETE /api/clients/250/entities/393/journal-entries/144. We need to see the server response to this and confirm UI behavior.
Agent, please prioritize fixing User Issue #1: The initial loading of entities after login and ensuring they appear in selectors without requiring a page reload. Focus your efforts on AuthContext.tsx (post-login actions) and EntityContext.tsx (entity query enabled state and data propagation). Provide logs specifically around the user login, the /api/entities fetch attempt (request headers if possible, and full response), and the subsequent state of EntityContext.
