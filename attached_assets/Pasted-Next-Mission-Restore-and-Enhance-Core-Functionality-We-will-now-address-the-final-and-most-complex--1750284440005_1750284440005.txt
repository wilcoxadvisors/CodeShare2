Next Mission: Restore and Enhance Core Functionality
We will now address the final and most complex piece of feedback you provided.

Priority 3: Overhaul the Account Selector

1. Goal:

Completely overhaul the account selector dropdown in the JournalEntryLinesTable to be best-in-class. It must be fast, intuitive, and provide clear hierarchical context to the user, similar to the functionality we had before the refactor.

2. Analysis:

Your feedback that the selector "looks like shit and do not work like they did" is clear. The current implementation is a basic dropdown that does not properly display the hierarchical nature of the Chart of Accounts. An accountant needs to see the parent-child relationships between accounts to select the correct one.

3. Definitive Fix Plan:

The work will be focused inside the new JournalEntryLinesTable.tsx component.

Hierarchical Display:

The dropdown, when opened, must render the accounts in their proper tree structure. Parent accounts (e.g., "Assets") should be visually distinct from child accounts (e.g., "Cash").
Child accounts should be indented under their parents to make the hierarchy obvious.
Expand/Collapse Functionality:

Parent accounts must have a chevron icon (">") next to them.
Clicking a parent account should expand or collapse its children directly within the dropdown list, without closing the popover.
Intelligent Search:

The search bar inside the popover must filter the list effectively.
When a user searches, the list should show all matching accounts and automatically expand the parent accounts so the user can see the context of the matched accounts.
Clear Selection Indicator:

When an account is selected for a line, it should be clearly marked with a checkmark inside the dropdown. Only selectable child accounts should show a checkmark, not parent accounts.
4. Expected Outcome:

The account selector will be transformed from a basic dropdown into a powerful, interactive component. A user will be able to open the selector, see the full Chart of Accounts hierarchy, expand and collapse parent accounts, search for a specific account, and confidently select the correct one, seeing its context within the hierarchy. This is a critical usability feature for any accounting professional.
