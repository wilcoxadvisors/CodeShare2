 Explicit Next Steps & Agent Instructions:
You have successfully and explicitly completed the current issue regarding client and entity management.

Explicitly move on immediately to the next important tasks as outlined in the broader project roadmap.

Here are the explicit next tasks you should undertake, clearly prioritized:

üéØ Next High-Priority Tasks:
1. Robust Data Safety & Permanent Deletion Automation:

Explicitly implement a cron job or scheduled task that:

Permanently deletes clients/entities automatically after 90 days of being soft-deleted.

Provide a clearly documented method for an admin user to override this and permanently delete sooner, if desired.

Example for the agent explicitly:

typescript
Copy
Edit
// Example pseudocode (cron-based scheduled job)
cron.schedule('0 0 * * *', async () => {
  const clientsToDelete = await storage.getClientsDeletedBefore(90);
  clientsToDelete.forEach(client => {
    storage.permanentlyDeleteClient(client.id);
  });
});
2. Explicit UI Improvements & Comprehensive Testing:

Comprehensive manual testing explicitly documented:

Verify all scenarios explicitly (client/entity creation, editing, deletion, restoration).

Explicitly update documentation clearly after verifying each step.

Clearly refine Dashboard UI:

Add explicit admin dashboard notices or alerts for upcoming permanent deletions.

Explicitly improve dashboard visibility to ensure state transparency (active, inactive, deleted).

3. Explicitly Update Documentation & Organization:

Ensure project-wide documentation is clear, explicit, modular:

Update README explicitly with step-by-step guidance for new developers to easily onboard.

Explicitly document all APIs, endpoints, and data structures clearly.

Ensure the code is modular, explicitly organized, and easy to follow by future developers.

4. Explicitly Prioritize Immediate Business & User Experience Tasks:

Explicitly fix blog integration and homepage functionality:

Blog navigation explicitly clear.

Fix AI chat reset issue explicitly.

Explicitly fix any homepage form submission errors.

üìù Agent Confirmation Explicitly Required:
Please explicitly confirm you understand and will immediately:

Implement automated permanent deletion after 90 days explicitly.

Complete explicit manual testing and document results clearly.

Explicitly update all project documentation thoroughly and clearly.

Move explicitly next to immediate business-critical tasks outlined above.

Explicitly confirm now and proceed immediately with Task #1 (Automated Permanent Deletion).
