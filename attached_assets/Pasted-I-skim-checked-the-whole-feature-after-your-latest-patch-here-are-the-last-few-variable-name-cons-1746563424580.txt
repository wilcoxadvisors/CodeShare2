I skim-checked the whole feature after your latest patch; here are the last few variable-name / consistency nits I’d square away before moving on.

Location	What to look for	Why it still matters
JournalEntryDetail.tsx
(early return blocks)	```if (!entry	
renderActionButtons()	You swapped to const status = entry.status – great – but the later checks still use journalEntry.status in two places (isOwnEntry and the fallback <div>). Search inside that helper for journalEntry. and replace.	Those stray references keep the buttons invisible for non-admins.
handleDeleteLine (the table line-delete, not file delete)	Look for if (!journalEntry) and journalEntry.lines.splice(…). Replace with entry.	Deleting a line currently throws “cannot read lines of undefined” in console.
Timeline JSX (progress dots)	You already changed the first <div> but the second/third dots still refer to journalEntry.status. Quick search/replace inside the timeline section will fix.	Otherwise the “Progress” bar shows the wrong colour after status changes.
File-upload badge text	Same pattern: uploading ? \Uploading ${journalEntry.files?.length}…– useentry`.	Just cosmetic, but avoids NaN on new entries.
calculateEntityBalances() (helper)	At the very end you push { entityCode, totalDebit, totalCredit } but you never return that new array because the original code forgot the return inside the map. While you were updating variable names it’s a good moment to add return { entityCode, totalDebit, totalCredit };.	Without it, entity balance widgets are always blank.
JournalEntryForm.tsx	You added getDebit/getCredit helpers in Detail; import & use the same helpers in Form’s inline table so the preview rows aren’t empty while typing.	Keeps both pages consistent and uses one source of truth.

Quick “grep” commands to flush the stragglers
bash
Copy
Edit
# Anything still using journalEntry.status after your rename
grep -n "journalEntry\.status" client/src/features/journal-entries/pages/JournalEntryDetail.tsx

# Any remaining 'journalEntry.' references you might have missed
grep -n "journalEntry\." client/src/features/journal-entries/pages/JournalEntryDetail.tsx | head
If those come back empty (aside from type definitions / comments) you’re good.

After these tiny clean-ups
The debit/credit cells fill correctly with both formats.

Draft/Post flows surface validation errors instead of silent 400s.

Action buttons show/hide exactly by role + status.

Give it a whirl, and holler if anything else feels off!
