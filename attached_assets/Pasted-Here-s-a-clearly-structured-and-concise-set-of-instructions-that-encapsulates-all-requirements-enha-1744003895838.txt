Here’s a clearly structured and concise set of instructions that encapsulates all requirements, enhancements, and comprehensive testing cases clearly aligned with Odoo and Sage Intacct best practices:

# 📌 **Instructions: Enhanced Chart of Accounts Import/Export & Account Update Logic**

---

## ✅ **Implementation Objectives**

The following enhancements must be fully implemented into the Wilcox Advisors Accounting System (WAAS):

1. **Enhanced Account Update Logic**
2. **Detailed Error Messaging**
3. **Expanded Comprehensive Testing**
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**

---

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### 🟢 **1. Enhanced Account Update Logic**

Clearly implement the following rules for accounts with existing transactions:

| Action                     | Allowed          | Restricted (🚫) |
|----------------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Modify Account Fields** *(Name, Type, Subtype, Description, Parent Account, Subledger settings)* | ✅ Allowed      |                 |
| **Deactivate/Activate Account** *(Change Active status)*        | ✅ Allowed      |                 |
| **Delete Account** *(If existing transactions)* |                  | 🚫 Restricted  |

- Clearly display error messages if a deletion is attempted on accounts with transactions.
- Provide administrative override capabilities for deletions (Admin role only).

**Example Validation (pseudocode for `server/storage/accountStorage.ts`):**

```typescript
async function validateAccountUpdate(accountUpdate, userRole) {
  const existingAccount = await findAccount(accountUpdate.AccountCode);

  if (!existingAccount) {
    throw new Error(`Account ${accountUpdate.AccountCode} not found.`);
  }

  if (accountUpdate.action === 'delete') {
    const hasTransactions = await accountHasTransactions(existingAccount.AccountCode);
    if (hasTransactions && userRole !== 'Admin') {
      throw new Error(`Cannot delete account ${existingAccount.AccountCode}: account has existing transactions. Deactivate instead.`);
    }
  }

  // All other updates allowed
  return true;
}
```

---

### 🟢 **2. Enhance Error Messaging**

All import/export validations must clearly state:

- **Specific Field Issues:** Indicate exactly which fields triggered errors.
- **Detailed Reasoning:** Clearly describe why the validation failed.
- **Actionable Instructions:** Provide clear steps for users to resolve errors.

**Example Messages:**

- ✅ `"Error: AccountCode 1120 already exists in the import file."`
- ✅ `"Error: ParentCode 1500 does not exist. Please verify this account exists."`
- ✅ `"Error: Cannot delete account 4000 (Revenue) due to existing transactions. Consider deactivating instead."`

---

### 🟢 **3. Expanded Testing Coverage**

Conduct extensive testing with clearly documented scenarios and outcomes:

| Test Scenario | Test Details                                   | Expected Result |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Account Additions** | Bulk CSV/Excel import. All required/optional fields. | ✅ Accounts imported correctly |
| **Account Updates** | Update accounts (fields: Name, Type, Description, Parent, Active Status). Test accounts both **with** and **without** existing transactions. | ✅ Allowed updates succeed |
| **Deactivate/Activate Accounts** | Toggle Active/Inactive status repeatedly. | ✅ Active status toggles correctly |
| **Attempt Deletion (with transactions)** | Try to delete accounts with transaction history. | 🚫 Clear error message displayed |
| **Attempt Deletion (without transactions)** | Delete unused accounts. | ✅ Account deletion succeeds |
| **Invalid Parent Relationships** | Import referencing nonexistent parent accounts. | 🚫 Clearly identified and rejected |
| **Self & Circular References** | Import accounts referencing themselves or circular references. | 🚫 Clearly identified and rejected |
| **Large Imports** | Import files with 100+ accounts. | ✅ Successful performance (under 60 seconds) |
| **Special Character Handling** | Import accounts with special characters (quotes, commas, unicode). | ✅ Data integrity maintained |
| **Concurrent Imports** | Simultaneous multiple import attempts. | ✅ Stability confirmed, data integrity intact |

### 🟢 **4. Comprehensive Documentation**

Create thorough and user-friendly documentation clearly outlining:

- Clearly stated allowed and restricted account update operations.
- Step-by-step instructions for the import/export process, including required fields, optional fields, and validation requirements.
- Troubleshooting guides clearly addressing frequent errors and resolutions.

---

## 📝 **Explicit Testing Procedure**

Clearly document each test scenario, structured as follows:

- **Test Scenario:** Clearly state the goal.
- **Input Data:** Describe the CSV/Excel input.
- **Expected Outcome:** Clearly state expected results.
- **Actual Outcome:** Clearly record actual test results.
- **Issues & Resolutions:** Clearly document any discrepancies and fixes.

**Example:**

| Test Scenario | Description                    | Input Data             | Expected Outcome                  | Actual Outcome | Issues & Resolutions           |
|---------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| Account Update (transactions exist) | Modify Name and Type fields on account 1120 | updates_accounts.xlsx | Fields updated successfully | ✅ Passed      | -                               |
| Account Deletion (transactions exist) | Attempt deletion of account 1120 | delete_accounts.csv    | Rejected with clear error | ✅ Passed      | Clearly communicated error message |

---

## 🚨 **Important Restrictions & Guidelines (Like Odoo & Sage Intacct)**

- **Deletion Restrictions:** Accounts with transaction history can **never** be deleted—only deactivated. This follows standard accounting practices and is consistent with both **Odoo and Sage Intacct**.
- **Clear Hierarchical Structure:** Maintain clear parent-child account relationships and structured account numbering for clarity and usability (consistent with industry standards).
- **Comprehensive Error Feedback:** All validation errors must be clearly actionable, similar to Odoo's explicit validation messages.

---

## ✅ **Next Steps (Action Items)**

**Immediately Proceed With:**

1. **Implement Enhanced Account Update Logic**
   - Modify the existing logic (`accountStorage.ts`) according to provided guidelines.

2. **Enhance Error Messaging**
   - Clearly and specifically enhance validation errors in the import/export process.

3. **Expand and Conduct Comprehensive Testing**
   - Perform and document each described testing scenario explicitly.

4. **Finalize Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Clearly document functionalities, restrictions, and troubleshooting guidelines.
