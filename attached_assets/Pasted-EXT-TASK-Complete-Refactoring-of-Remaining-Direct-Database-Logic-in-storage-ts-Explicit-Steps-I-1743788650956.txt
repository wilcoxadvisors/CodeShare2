EXT TASK: Complete Refactoring of Remaining Direct Database Logic in storage.ts.

Explicit Steps:

Identify all remaining direct database operations in storage.ts by running:

grep -n -E "await db|await.*find|await.*create|await.*update|await.*delete" server/storage.ts | grep -v "await this." | grep -v "await.*Storage."

Document clearly each identified method, including exact line numbers and associated domain/module (e.g., User methods → userStorage.ts, Fixed Asset methods → assetStorage.ts, Form methods → formStorage.ts, etc.).

Explicitly move each documented method from storage.ts into its corresponding specialized storage module.

Explicitly update storage.ts to delegate each method clearly and correctly to the specialized storage modules using the established delegation pattern:

async methodName(args) { return this.specializedModule.methodName(args); }

Explicitly verify that no direct database logic remains in storage.ts by re-running:

grep -E "await db|await.*find|await.*create|await.*update|await.*delete" server/storage.ts | grep -v "await this." | grep -v "await.*Storage."

Run comprehensive verification by explicitly executing:

node verify-storage-modules.js

Ensure explicitly that all modules integrate correctly.

Update comprehensive tests explicitly to confirm that all new implementations function correctly and efficiently.

Explicitly confirm that the server still starts and responds appropriately post-refactoring by running:

curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/health

Agent’s Expected Response Format (Explicit):

Residual Logic Refactoring (storage.ts):

Identified Residual Logic:

[List clearly each identified method, including line numbers and intended specialized storage module destination.]

Refactoring Action Taken:

[List explicitly each method and its new specialized storage module.]

Delegation Updated in storage.ts:

[Explicitly confirm delegation pattern established for each method.]

Verification Results:

Confirmed explicitly no direct database logic remains in storage.ts.

Explicitly ran node verify-storage-modules.js; confirm all modules integrated correctly.

Explicitly verified server functionality post-refactor.

Testing & Documentation:

Tests explicitly updated and passed successfully.

Documentation explicitly updated and complete.

Final Status:

Refactoring of all residual logic explicitly verified and successfully completed.
