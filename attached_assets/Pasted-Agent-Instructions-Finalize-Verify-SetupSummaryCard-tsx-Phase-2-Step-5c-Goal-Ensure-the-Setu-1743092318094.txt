Agent Instructions: Finalize & Verify SetupSummaryCard.tsx (Phase 2, Step 5c)

Goal: Ensure the SetupSummaryCard.tsx component (Step 3 of the 3-step setup flow) correctly displays the client and entity information entered in the previous steps and that the "Finish" action successfully completes the setup process and updates the main dashboard.

Relevant Files:

client/src/components/setup/SetupSummaryCard.tsx
client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx (or SetupStepper.tsx - managing the flow state/handlers like clientData, entityData, onComplete, onBack, query invalidation)
Steps:

Review SetupSummaryCard.tsx Implementation:
Action: Open client/src/components/setup/SetupSummaryCard.tsx.
Verify Data Reception: Does the component correctly receive clientData and entityData (likely named entities in props) passed down from the parent (SetupStepper or Dashboard)? Add console.log for props if needed.
Verify Data Display: Does the component render a clear summary of the key client details (e.g., clientData.name) and the list of entities added (e.g., mapping props.entities to display entity.name, entity.code)?
Verify Button Labels: Is the final action button correctly labeled (e.g., "Finish Setup", "Complete", "Activate")?
Verify Navigation & Finalization:
Action: Examine the "Back" and "Finish Setup" button handlers.
Verify "Back" Button: Does the "Back" button correctly call the onBack prop, triggering the parent to setActiveStep(1) (returning to Step 2)?
Verify "Finish" Button Action: Does the "Finish Setup" button correctly call the onComplete prop?
Verify Parent onComplete Handler: In the parent component (SetupStepper or Dashboard), examine the onComplete handler function. Does it:
Close the setup modal/dialog (e.g., setAddClientDialogOpen(false))?
Trigger the necessary TanStack Query invalidation to refresh the main client list (queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['clients'] }))?
Test the Flow (Simulated):
Action: Simulate arriving at Step 3 with valid clientData and entityData from the previous steps.
Analyze:
Does the summary card display the correct client and entity information?
Simulate clicking "Back". Does it correctly return to Step 2?
Simulate navigating back to Step 3.
Simulate clicking "Finish Setup". Does the onComplete handler execute all necessary actions (close modal, invalidate query)? Check logs/code execution.
Verify Final Dashboard State (Simulated):
Analyze: After the onComplete handler runs and query invalidation occurs, simulate the main dashboard component re-fetching the client list. Would the newly added client now appear in the list based on the expected API response?
Report: Confirm that Step 3 (SetupSummaryCard) functions correctly â€“ displays the summary, handles "Back" navigation, and successfully triggers the "Finish" actions (closing modal and invalidating client list query). Report any errors or discrepancies found.
