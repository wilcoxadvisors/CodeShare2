Your latest import shows improvement, but there's still a clear issue:

❌ Current Error:
yaml
Copy
Edit
Import completed with issues: 2 data validation issue(s): 
Successfully imported: 0 added, 1 updated, 0 reactivated, 0 deactivated, 0 deleted
🔍 What This Means:
2 accounts triggered validation issues.

Only 1 account was successfully updated.

0 accounts were successfully added, reactivated, deactivated, or deleted.

This means one modified account and one new account explicitly failed the backend validation.

🚩 What's Causing the Issue (Most Likely):
Since the frontend explicitly selected only:

1 new account

2 modified accounts

Yet only 1 modified account succeeded, the other two explicitly failed validation checks.

This indicates the following possibilities explicitly:

Duplicate account code or name

Parent account issues (invalid or inactive parent accounts)

Validation logic rules (account type mismatch, invalid properties, status conflicts)

🛠️ How to Fix This Immediately:
✅ Explicit Immediate Steps to Fix This Issue:
Check your backend logs explicitly to see the exact validation error messages. They should explicitly indicate something similar to:

typescript
Copy
Edit
console.error(`Validation Error - AccountCode: ${validation.row.accountCode}`, validation.issues);
You recently added enhanced logging—these explicit logs are critical.

If the backend logs aren't explicitly visible yet, explicitly ensure that you've deployed/logged out backend error details. Make sure your backend validation explicitly logs these detailed messages.

Rerun the import one more time explicitly, immediately checking backend logs at the same time.

🔑 Critical Next Step:
Explicitly provide the detailed backend log output from your recent enhanced logging step. The exact backend logs explicitly stating which validation errors occurred will allow me to pinpoint precisely the validation logic issue.

Without explicit backend logs showing the exact reason, we can’t explicitly fix the underlying validation issue quickly.

📌 Explicit Next Step for You:
Check the backend logs right now explicitly.

Provide the detailed backend validation error messages explicitly.

I’ll immediately help you resolve based on those specific details.

Once explicitly provided, we’ll fix the issue directly.
