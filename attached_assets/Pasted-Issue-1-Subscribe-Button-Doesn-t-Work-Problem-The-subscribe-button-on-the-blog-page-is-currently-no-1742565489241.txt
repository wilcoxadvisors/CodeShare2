Issue 1: Subscribe Button Doesn’t Work
Problem
The subscribe button on the blog page is currently non-functional. It’s intended to capture email addresses from users who want to subscribe and then send them blog updates whenever a new post is published from the admin dashboard. These email addresses should also be stored in a database for future use.

Solution
To resolve this, you’ll need to implement a subscription system that integrates the frontend, backend, and database, along with an email notification process. Here’s how to approach it step by step:

Database Setup
Create a table in your database (e.g., blog_subscribers) to store subscriber details. Include columns like id (unique identifier), email (to store the subscriber’s email), and subscribed_at (timestamp of subscription).
Add a unique constraint on the email column to avoid duplicate subscriptions.
Frontend Integration
Modify the subscribe button on the blog page to capture the user’s email input from a form field.
Add basic validation to ensure the email format is correct (e.g., includes an "@" and domain).
When clicked, the button should send the email to the backend via an API request.
Backend API
Set up a new API endpoint (e.g., POST /api/subscribe) on your server to handle subscription requests.
In this endpoint, validate the email, check if it already exists in the blog_subscribers table, and add it if it’s new.
Send a success response back to the frontend to confirm the subscription.
Email Notification System
In the admin dashboard, when a new blog post is published, add logic to fetch all email addresses from the blog_subscribers table.
Use an email-sending tool (like a library or service) to send the new blog post details to each subscriber.
Ensure this is triggered automatically when the post’s status changes to “published.”
Testing
Test the full process: subscribe with an email, publish a blog post, and verify the email is received.
Check edge cases, such as submitting an invalid email or subscribing with an already-used email.
This will ensure the subscribe button works, emails are stored, and subscribers get updates as intended.

Issue 2: Blog Articles Are Placeholders
Problem
The blog articles currently shown on the blog page are static placeholders. Instead, they should be dynamically sourced from real content managed through the admin dashboard, with functionality to create, edit, and delete posts.

Solution
To replace placeholders with a dynamic blog system connected to the admin dashboard, follow these steps:

Database Schema
Confirm or create a blog_posts table in your database with columns like id, title, content, author_id (linked to a user), published_at (timestamp), and status (e.g., draft or published).
Ensure it connects to a users table to track who wrote each post.
Admin Dashboard Integration
Add a blog management section to the admin dashboard where admins can:
Create: Write new posts with a form for title, content, and status.
Read: View a list of all posts with options to edit or delete.
Update: Edit existing posts.
Delete: Remove or archive posts.
Make this section accessible only to admin users.
Backend API
Build API endpoints to manage blog posts:
GET /api/blog/posts: Retrieve all published posts for the blog page.
POST /api/blog/posts: Add a new post.
PUT /api/blog/posts/:id: Update an existing post.
DELETE /api/blog/posts/:id: Delete a post.
Secure these endpoints so only admins can modify content.
Frontend Blog Page
Update the blog page to fetch posts from the GET /api/blog/posts endpoint.
Replace the placeholder content with a dynamic display that loops through the fetched posts, showing each post’s title, a short excerpt, and a “Read More” link to the full content.
Publishing Workflow
When an admin sets a post’s status to “published” in the dashboard, it should appear on the blog page immediately.
Add a “Publish Now” option that sets the published_at timestamp and triggers any notifications (e.g., to subscribers from Issue 1).
This connects the blog page to the admin dashboard, replacing placeholders with real, manageable content.

Issue 3: Remove Social Media and “Connect With Us” from Homepage
Problem
The homepage includes unwanted social media links (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) and a “Connect With Us” section that need to be removed to streamline the design.

Solution
To eliminate these elements from the homepage, take the following steps:

Locate the Homepage Component
Identify the part of your project that controls the homepage layout (likely a main page component or template).
Remove Social Media Links
Find and delete any references to Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. This includes icons, text labels, or hyperlinks pointing to those platforms.
Ensure no remnants (e.g., empty containers) are left behind.
Remove “Connect With Us” Section
Locate the “Connect With Us” section, which might be a distinct block or area encouraging user interaction.
Remove this entire section, including its title, text, and any associated elements like buttons or forms.
Adjust Layout
After removal, check the homepage layout to ensure it still looks balanced. If there’s a gap, adjust the spacing or styling to fill it naturally.
Optionally, replace the removed section with something else, like a call-to-action (e.g., “Subscribe to our blog”), to keep users engaged.
Test the Changes
Preview the homepage to confirm the social media links and “Connect With Us” section are gone.
Verify the layout looks clean and there are no errors or broken elements left behind.
This will declutter the homepage, focusing it on the content you want to highlight.

Summary
Subscribe Button: Set up a database table for subscribers, capture emails via an API, and send updates when new posts are published.
Blog Articles: Replace placeholders with a dynamic system tied to a blog_posts table, managed through the admin dashboard with CRUD functionality.
Homepage Cleanup: Remove social media links (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) and the “Connect With Us” section, adjusting the layout as needed.
These solutions can be implemented step-by-step to improve the blog page and homepage without disrupting your existing setup. Let me know if you need further guidance on any part!
