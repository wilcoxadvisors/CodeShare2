The user tested the attachment feature (Checkpoint 68c54be1) and reported multiple critical failures. We need to debug the core upload and display flow.

Tasks:

Verify Backend Multi-File Upload & Storage:

Go to server/journalEntryRoutes.ts and find the POST /api/journal-entries/:id/files route handler.
Add Logging:
Inside the handler, log req.files (the array of files received from multer) before iterating through it: console.log('DEBUG Attach BE: Received req.files:', req.files);
Inside the loop that processes req.files, log which file is being processed and the data being sent to journalEntryStorage.createJournalEntryFile: console.log('DEBUG Attach BE: Processing file:', file.originalname, ' Data to storage:', dataForStorage);
Go to server/storage/journalEntryStorage.ts and find the createJournalEntryFile function.
Add Logging: Log the data received and the result of the database insert: console.log('DEBUG Attach Storage: createJournalEntryFile called with:', fileData); and console.log('DEBUG Attach Storage: Insert result:', insertResult);
Verify Backend File List Retrieval:

Go to server/journalEntryRoutes.ts and find the GET /api/journal-entries/:id/files route handler.
Add Logging: Log the result returned from journalEntryStorage.getJournalEntryFiles before sending the response: console.log('DEBUG Attach BE: Files retrieved for entry', req.params.id, ':', files);
Go to server/storage/journalEntryStorage.ts and find the getJournalEntryFiles function.
Add Logging: Log the result of the database query: console.log('DEBUG Attach Storage: getJournalEntryFiles DB result:', queryResult);
Verify Frontend File List Fetching:

Go to client/src/features/journal-entries/pages/JournalEntryDetail.tsx.
Find the useQuery hook used to fetch attachments (likely calling GET /api/journal-entries/:id/files, potentially named useGetAttachments).
Add Logging: Log the data returned by the useQuery hook: console.log('DEBUG Attach FE: Data from useGetAttachments:', data);
Verify Frontend List Rendering:

In JournalEntryDetail.tsx, find the JSX section that is supposed to render the list of files (likely mapping over the data fetched in step 3).
Add Logging: Inside the map function (or wherever the list items are generated), log the data for each file being rendered: console.log('DEBUG Attach FE: Rendering file list item:', file);
Re-run Test:

Ask the user to go to an existing journal entry, upload two different allowed files (e.g., a PDF and a JPG) using the drag-drop or button.
Then, reload the page.
Report Findings:

Provide the output of all the new DEBUG logs (Backend Upload, Backend List, Frontend Fetch, Frontend Render).
Does the backend log show both files being received and processed by storage?
Does the backend log show both files being retrieved?
Does the frontend log show both files being received from the API?
Does the frontend log show it attempting to render both file list items?
This will help us isolate whether the problem is in saving multiple files, retrieving the list, fetching it in the frontend, or rendering the fetched list."
Regarding the Edit Page:

Could you clarify what you mean by "The system seems to have gotten rid of the edit page"? Are you unable to find the button to edit draft journal entries, or does clicking it lead to an error or the wrong page? The NewJournalEntry.tsx page should handle both creating new entries and editing existing (draft) entries based on the URL.

Let's focus on fixing the attachments first with the prompt above. Please provide the logs after the agent adds them and you re-run the test.
