Task Assignment: Verify Refactoring with Compiler & Proceed with CoA Verification

Context:
The extensive refactoring to replace the Chart of Accounts code field with accountCode is now complete across all identified files (checkpoint e31795bb). The next step is to verify the code's integrity using the TypeScript compiler, and then proceed with the re-seeding and UI checks to confirm the original CoA data display bug is resolved.

Goal:

Ensure the codebase compiles successfully after the refactoring.
Execute the re-seeding process and verify the CoA data display fix in the UI.
Part 1: Verify Code with TypeScript Compiler

Instructions:

Action: Run TypeScript Compiler Check:
From the project root directory, execute the TypeScript compiler check: npx tsc --noEmit
If errors occur: Analyze the compiler errors. Fix them in the relevant files. Repeat this step until npx tsc --noEmit passes without any errors.
Verification (Part 1):

Confirm npx tsc --noEmit completes successfully.
Reporting (Part 1):

Report the result of the npx tsc --noEmit check (must be successful). Report any errors encountered and fixed during this process.
State that you are now proceeding to Part 2.
Part 2: Re-Seed Data & Verify UI Display

Instructions:

Action: Re-Seed Existing Clients (Carefully!):

Ensure the scripts/seed-existing-clients-coa.ts script includes the safety check to only process clients with zero existing accounts.
Run the updated script from the project root: ./scripts/seed-existing-coa.sh
Monitor Output: Carefully observe and record the console logs.
Action: Verify Seeding for New Client via UI:

Restart the application if necessary (npm run dev).
Log in and use the UI to create a completely new test client via the full "Add Client" setup flow.
After setup completion, navigate directly to the Chart of Accounts page for this new client.
Verify: Does the standard CoA data appear correctly?
Action: Verify Data Display for Existing Client via UI:

Navigate to the Chart of Accounts page for an existing client that the seeding script should have processed (e.g., Client ID 1).
Verify: Does the standard CoA data appear correctly?
Verification (Part 2):

Confirm the manual seeding script ran (check logs for success/errors).
Confirm CoA data is visible in the UI for a newly created client.
Confirm CoA data is visible in the UI for an existing, re-seeded client.
Reporting (Part 2):

Provide the console output from running ./scripts/seed-existing-coa.sh.
Report PASS/FAIL for the New Client UI Verification (Step 3).
Report PASS/FAIL for the Existing Client UI Verification (Step 4).
If both UI verifications pass, confirm that the original "CoA data not displaying" bug is resolved and Task B.1 is fully complete.
