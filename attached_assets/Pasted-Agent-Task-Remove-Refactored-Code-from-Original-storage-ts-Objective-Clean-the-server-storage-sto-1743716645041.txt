Agent Task: Remove Refactored Code from Original storage.ts

Objective:
Clean the server/storage/storage.ts file by removing the code segments that have been successfully refactored and moved into the new, specific storage modules (accountStorage.ts, clientStorage.ts, etc.) today, April 3, 2025.

Target File for Cleanup:

server/storage/storage.ts
Reference Files (Containing Moved Code):

server/storage/accountStorage.ts
server/storage/clientStorage.ts
server/storage/consolidationStorage.ts
server/storage/entityStorage.ts
server/storage/journalEntryStorage.ts
server/storage/userStorage.ts
Instructions:

Identify Moved Entities: Programmatically determine the primary functions, classes, constants, and types that are exported from each of the new reference files (e.g., identify everything exported from accountStorage.ts, then clientStorage.ts, etc.).
Locate Originals in storage.ts: For each entity identified in Step 1, locate its original definition (the corresponding function, class, constant declaration, associated interfaces/types) within the target file server/storage/storage.ts.
Identify Code Blocks for Removal: Mark the entire code block for each identified original entity within server/storage/storage.ts for removal. This includes:
The full function/class definition.
Related helper functions or variables if they are only used by the code being removed and not by any code remaining in storage.ts. (Use caution here).
Associated type/interface definitions if they are no longer needed by any remaining code in storage.ts.
Identify and Remove Unused Imports: After identifying the code blocks for removal, determine which import statements at the top of server/storage/storage.ts are now unused (i.e., they only supplied dependencies for the code being removed). Mark these imports for removal.
Execute Removal (High Caution Required):
Delete the identified code blocks (Step 3) from server/storage/storage.ts.
Delete the identified unused import statements (Step 4) from server/storage/storage.ts.
CRITICAL: Ensure the removal process does not leave syntactically invalid code or dangling references in the remaining parts of storage.ts.
Verification (Mandatory):
Run linting tools on the modified server/storage/storage.ts. Fix any errors.
Execute the full project build/compilation process. Confirm it succeeds without errors related to storage.ts or files that might import from it.
Run all automated test suites (unit, integration, E2E). Verify that all tests pass, paying special attention to any tests that might have previously interacted directly with the now-removed parts of storage.ts.
Report:
Detail precisely which functions, classes, types, and imports were removed from server/storage/storage.ts.
Confirm successful linting, build, and test execution.
Flag any ambiguities encountered or removals that might have uncertain side effects. Recommend specific areas for human review if confidence is not 100%.
