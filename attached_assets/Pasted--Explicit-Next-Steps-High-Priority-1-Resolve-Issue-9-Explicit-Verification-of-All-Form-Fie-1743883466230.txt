üéØ Explicit Next Steps (High Priority)
üö© 1. Resolve Issue #9: Explicit Verification of All Form Fields Persisting
Objective:
Explicitly confirm every form field (Client & Entity forms) saves, updates, and persists correctly through save ‚Üí edit ‚Üí refresh cycles.

Explicit Verification Steps:

Client Forms:

Add a new client explicitly filling out every form field available.

Explicitly save and verify via UI feedback ("Successfully saved").

Explicitly refresh the client detail page; verify all fields correctly persist.

Explicitly edit each field, explicitly change values, save explicitly, and explicitly refresh again.

Explicitly verify changes are explicitly reflected after refresh.

Entity Forms:

Explicitly create an entity under the previously added client.

Fill in explicitly every form field.

Explicitly save and verify persistence through refresh.

Explicitly edit each entity field, explicitly save, and explicitly verify post-refresh.

Explicitly document:

Any field that fails to persist or update explicitly.

UI responsiveness explicitly (including explicit feedback messages).

‚ö†Ô∏è 2. Ensure Explicit Clarity between "Inactive" and "Soft Deletion" (Critical)
Objective:
Ensure that the existing "Inactive" entity toggle and the new explicit "Soft Deletion" functionality do not conflict.

Explicit Verification and Actions:

Explicitly update your logic in frontend/backend to clearly differentiate states:

Inactive Entity (Explicitly NOT deleted):

js
Copy
Edit
await updateEntity(id, { active: false, deletedAt: null });
Soft-Deleted Entity (Explicitly deleted):

js
Copy
Edit
await updateEntity(id, { active: false, deletedAt: new Date() });
Explicitly verify UI/UX filtering logic matches this clear distinction:

Active entities (default view):

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM entities WHERE active = true AND deleted_at IS NULL;
Inactive entities (not deleted) explicitly:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM entities WHERE active = false AND deleted_at IS NULL;
Explicitly Soft-Deleted entities:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM entities WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL;
Explicitly test:

Marking entity explicitly inactive via existing "Inactive" toggle/button.

Explicitly soft-deleting entity via explicit delete action.

Explicitly restoring soft-deleted entities explicitly via restore button/dialog.

Explicitly confirm UI explicitly shows each entity state correctly.

‚úÖ 3. Manual End-to-End Testing (Explicitly including CoA and Overall Functionality)
Objective:
Conduct explicit end-to-end manual verification of key functionality, explicitly emphasizing the Chart of Accounts (CoA) and integrated modules.

Explicitly Recommended Test Flow:

Setup & Login:

Explicitly log into the app as an Admin user.

Explicitly Add Client:

Use explicit step-by-step guided setup (SetupStepper.tsx).

Explicitly verify client creation and persistence.

Explicitly Add Entity:

Explicitly create new entity within the client.

Explicitly verify field persistence explicitly.

Explicitly Chart of Accounts (CoA):

Add Account explicitly:

Verify account creation, explicit accountCode uniqueness enforcement, and hierarchy creation.

Edit Account explicitly:

Explicitly test updates to hierarchy, names, and reporting fields.

Delete Account explicitly:

Explicitly test explicit deletion constraints (parent with/without child accounts).

Import/Export explicitly (CSV/Excel):

Explicitly verify UI & functionality explicitly (no errors, correct data).

Explicitly Test General Ledger & Journal Entries:

Explicitly add manual journal entry, explicitly verifying debit=credit validation explicitly.

Explicitly verify batch upload explicitly via prepared CSV/JSON.

Explicitly Test Soft Deletion and Inactive States:

Explicitly test marking entities inactive explicitly.

Explicitly test soft-deletion explicitly.

Explicitly verify restore explicitly.

Explicitly Verify UI/UX and Responsiveness:

Explicitly confirm good UX/UI explicitly.

Explicitly check mobile responsiveness explicitly (browser dev tools).

Explicitly Document:

All explicit steps pass/fail explicitly.

Explicit screenshots of any explicit issue or unexpected behavior.

Explicit console errors/logs if issues explicitly encountered.

üöß After Explicit Verification Completion:
Explicitly proceed to the next task (B.3 - Accounts Payable Backend).

Explicitly address and resolve any found issues immediately.

üéØ Explicit Next Action for Agent Team:
Explicitly proceed with Issue #9 and subsequent manual verification steps outlined above.

Let me know explicitly if you encounter any questions or roadblocks.
