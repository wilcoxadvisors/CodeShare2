Architect's Mission: Decompose the Journal Entry Form
Phase 1, Step 1: Extract JournalEntryHeader Component

1. Goal:

Create a new JournalEntryHeader component by extracting the header-related fields (Date, Reference, Description, and the Auto-Reversing Accrual section) from the main JournalEntryForm.tsx. This is the first step in cleaning up the "god component."

2. Definitive Plan:

I need you to perform the following surgical refactoring.

Create New File:

Create a new file at: client/src/features/journal-entries/components/JournalEntryHeader.tsx.
Define Component and Props:

Inside the new file, create a React functional component named JournalEntryHeader.
This component will need to accept props from its parent (JournalEntryForm). Define an interface for these props, which will include:
journalData: The state object containing the form's header values (date, description, etc.).
setJournalData: The state setter function to update the journalData object.
fieldErrors: The object containing any validation errors for the header fields.
existingEntry: The original journal entry object, used to determine the display ID.
autoReferencePrefix: The system-generated part of the reference number.
Migrate JSX:

Go to client/src/features/journal-entries/components/JournalEntryForm.tsx.
Carefully cut the entire JSX block that renders the main header. This starts with the div containing the "Journal Entry ID" and ends after the div for the "Auto-Reversing Accrual" settings.
Paste this JSX into the return statement of your new JournalEntryHeader.tsx component.
Refactor JournalEntryForm.tsx:

In the original JournalEntryForm.tsx, import the new JournalEntryHeader component.
In the location where you just cut the JSX, render the new component, passing all the necessary props you defined in Step 2.
You will also need to move any helper functions or state that are used only by the header (like handleChange for the header inputs) into the new component to ensure it is self-contained.
5. Expected Outcome:

The application's functionality will be identical to before.
The JournalEntryForm.tsx component will be significantly smaller and cleaner.
We will have a new, reusable JournalEntryHeader.tsx component, marking the successful first step in our modular refactoring effort.
Please proceed with this first step.
