rchitect's Mission: Implement Intelligent Search
1. Goal:

Enhance the refactored Dimension Tag Selector with "intelligent search" functionality, mirroring the behavior of the hierarchical account selector. The search must filter the list while preserving the hierarchical context.

2. Core Requirements:

Filter Values: When a user types in the search box, the list must only show dimension values that match the search term.
Preserve Hierarchy: The parent dimension for any matching value must remain visible.
Auto-Expand: Parent dimensions that contain matching search results must be automatically expanded to reveal those results.
3. Definitive Fix Plan:

The work will be focused within the client/src/features/journal-entries/components/JournalEntryLinesTable.tsx component. We will add the filtering and auto-expansion logic.

Create a Filtered List with useMemo:

We need a memoized value that recalculates only when the search query or the base dimensions change.
Wrap the filtering logic in a useMemo hook that depends on safeDimensions and searchQuery.
Implement the Filtering Logic:

If searchQuery is empty, the useMemo should simply return the original filteredDimensions (the ones with values).
If searchQuery has text, it must perform a deeper filter:
Iterate through each dimension.
For each dimension, create a new matchingValues array by filtering its values to find items where value.name or value.code includes the searchQuery.
If matchingValues is not empty, return a new dimension object that includes the original dimension data but with its values property replaced by the matchingValues array.
This will produce a new array of dimensions that contains only the filtered results.
Implement Auto-Expansion:

Create another useMemo hook that generates an autoExpanded state object.
This hook will depend on the searchQuery and the filtered list from the previous step.
If searchQuery is active, it should iterate over the filtered dimensions and add each dimension.id to the autoExpanded object with a value of true.
Combine this with the user's manual expansion state: const combinedExpandedState = { ...expandedAccounts, ...autoExpandedAccounts };
Update the JSX Renderer:

The main .map() function should now iterate over the new, memoized, filtered list of dimensions.
The condition to check if a dimension is expanded should use the combinedExpandedState object.
4. Expected Outcome:

The user experience will now be perfect. If a user types "Sales" into the search box:

Only the "Department" dimension will remain visible (assuming it's the only one with a "Sales" value).
The "Department" dimension will automatically expand.
Only the "Sales" value will appear underneath it, ready to be selected.
This completes the full overhaul of the dimension selector, bringing it to the same high standard as the account selector and providing a truly professional-grade user experience.
