Task Assignment: Verify Enhanced CoA Import UI and Functionality

Context:
Based on user feedback, the Chart of Accounts import preview UI in client/src/pages/ChartOfAccounts.tsx was significantly redesigned (checkpoint fcd0e627) to allow granular approval of additions, modifications, and actions for missing accounts via checkboxes. We need to verify this new UI and its corresponding backend processing work correctly.

Goal:
Verify the enhanced CoA import preview dialog functions as designed: displays changes correctly in sections (New/Modified/Missing), allows individual selection via checkboxes, handles actions for missing accounts, and correctly applies only the selected changes upon submission.

Instructions:

Part 1: Prepare for Test

Action: Confirm Test Files:

Ensure the updated test files are available and contain data that will trigger additions, modifications, and omissions (missing accounts):
test/data/coa-import/updated-tests/test-accounts-import-updated.csv
test/data/coa-import/updated-tests/test-accounts-import-updated.xlsx
Action: Ensure Application is Running & Authenticated:

Verify the application is running (npm run dev).
Simulate logging in as admin (admin / password123).
Part 2: Verify Import Preview Dialog UI & Functionality

Action: Initiate Import & Observe Preview Dialog (CSV):

Use the web application tool to navigate to the CoA page for a test client with existing accounts (e.g., Client ID 1).
Simulate clicking "Import" and uploading the test CSV file (test-accounts-import-updated.csv).
Observe the Preview Dialog:
Confirm the old "Update Strategy" / "Missing Accounts Strategy" radio buttons are gone.
Confirm distinct sections exist for "New Accounts", "Modified Accounts", and "Missing Accounts".
Confirm each listed account change (add, modify, missing) has an individual checkbox next to it.
Confirm "Select All" checkboxes exist for each section and function correctly (selecting/deselecting all items in that section).
For the "Missing Accounts" section:
Is there a selection mechanism (e.g., dropdown) next to each checkbox with options "Mark inactive" and "Delete"?
Is the "Delete" option appropriately disabled if the account cannot be deleted (e.g., has transactions - though this logic might not be fully implemented yet, note if it's always enabled/disabled)?
Capture evidence (screenshots/description) of the preview dialog layout and controls.
Action: Test Selection Logic & Submission (CSV):

Interact with the checkboxes:
Select some but not all new accounts.
Select some but not all modified accounts.
Select different actions ("Mark inactive" / "Delete") for some but not all missing accounts using their checkboxes and action selectors.
Observe the submit button text (e.g., "Apply X selected changes"). Does the count
