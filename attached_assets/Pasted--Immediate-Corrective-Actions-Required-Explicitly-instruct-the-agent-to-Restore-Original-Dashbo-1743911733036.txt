ðŸš© Immediate Corrective Actions Required:
Explicitly instruct the agent to:

Restore Original Dashboard Tab

Explicitly revert to the original UI layout (restoring from Dashboard.tsx.bak).

Ensure no functionality from the original dashboard (blog management, AI content generation card, analytics) is lost.

Integrate, Not Replace, AdminWebsiteContent Component

Embed the newly developed dynamic homepage content management (AdminWebsiteContent.tsx) within the existing tab structure.

Maintain explicit separation of Homepage and Blog management within clearly labeled sub-tabs or sections.

Explicitly Hook-up AI-driven Blog Management

Explicitly ensure the blog management UI is connected to the backend API (/api/blog/posts) and AI service (/api/ai/blog/generate) for:

AI-generated post drafts

Editing and approval workflows

Multimedia embedding (images/videos)

SEO metadata editing (metaTitle, metaDescription)

Comprehensive Verification & Documentation

Explicitly test and verify:

Homepage content CRUD explicitly operational.

Blog post CRUD explicitly operational with AI integration.

Explicitly document the verification clearly in ADMIN_CONTENT_INTEGRATION_VERIFICATION.md:

## Admin Content Integration Verification (2025-04-06)

| Task                                                        | Status |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Original Dashboard UI explicitly restored                   | âœ…     |
| Dynamic homepage content explicitly integrated              | âœ…     |
| Blog post management explicitly integrated                  | âœ…     |
| AI-driven content explicitly integrated & operational       | âœ…     |
| Comprehensive CRUD explicitly verified (homepage & blog)    | âœ…     |
| SEO & multimedia explicitly verified                        | âœ…     |
ðŸŽ¯ Explicit Updated Instructions for the Agent:
Agent should explicitly confirm understanding, then proceed with:

Immediately restore original Dashboard.tsx from backup explicitly:

bash
Copy
Edit
cp Dashboard.tsx.bak ./client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
Explicitly integrate AdminWebsiteContent.tsx within existing dashboard structure (no replacements).

Explicitly verify full CRUD and AI-integration for both homepage content and blog posts.

Clearly document verification steps and outcomes explicitly as listed above.

ðŸš© Next Steps After Correction (Explicitly ordered):
After explicitly resolving this dashboard integration issue, explicitly address:

Issue #6: Homepage Blog Previews not displaying.

Issue #7: Blog Subscription Form Submission Error.

Accounting Module: Implement the accounting module with batch journal entries (explicitly remove HistoricalDataUpload.tsx).

Future Enhancements: Proactive AI-driven website health monitoring and XAI integrations.
