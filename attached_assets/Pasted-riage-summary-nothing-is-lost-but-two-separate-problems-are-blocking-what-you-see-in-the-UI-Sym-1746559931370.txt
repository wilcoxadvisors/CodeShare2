riage summary — nothing is “lost,” but two separate problems are blocking what you see in the UI
Symptom	Root-cause sketch	Quick test
1. JEs not listed after you create them	Front-end query invalidates "/api/clients/:cId/entities/:eId/journal-entries" … but the list component is still calling the old flat URL (/api/entities/:eId/journal-entries). That call now 404s, so React Query shows an empty set.	Open DevTools → Network tab after Save → Look for the list call; you’ll see the 404.
2. 401s to /api/auth/me and /api/entities after a while	Session cookie expires (or is cleared on hot-reload). When the FE sees 401 it doesn’t force a re-login, so subsequent entity & JE fetches all fail.	Hard-refresh the page → you should be redirected to /login, then the 401s disappear.
3. “Post” gives a 400	Our new hierarchical POST /api/clients/:cId/entities/:eId/journal-entries validator still requires Balance = 0 and referenceNumber to be unique. Your test entry had debit 2 / credit 2 (good) but referenceNumber: "new1" already exists → 400.	Repeat with a fresh reference string (“new3”) – it posts fine.

Immediate unblock steps for you
Log back in (refresh or hit /logout then /login).

After creating / posting a JE, manually hit:

bash
Copy
Edit
GET /api/clients/251/entities/392/journal-entries
You’ll see the entries are there.

Fixes the agent will push (ETA < 1 hr)
A. Update list hook to use the hierarchical URL
client/src/features/journal-entries/hooks/useJournalEntries.ts

diff
Copy
Edit
- const url = `/api/entities/${entityId}/journal-entries`;
+ const url = getJournalEntriesBaseUrl(clientId, entityId);
Invalidate that same key in invalidateJournalEntryQueries().

B. Add a 401 interceptor to apiRequest
ts
Copy
Edit
if (response.status === 401) {
  window.location.assign('/login');
  return Promise.reject(new Error('Unauthenticated'));
}
C. Clarify 400 error coming from the validator
Return JSON { field:"referenceNumber", message:"duplicate" } so the FE shows a toast instead of “Failed to load”.

I’ll get those patches in a branch fix/je-list-401 and ping when CI is green.
Let me know if anything else looks off!
