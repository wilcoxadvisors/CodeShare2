Architect's Mission: Resolve Conflicting State Logic (Final)
1. Goal

Permanently eradicate the "phantom checkmark" bug by resolving the conflicting state management logic within the GlobalContextSelector component.

2. Root Cause Analysis

After a final review of the logs and your feedback, the root cause is clear. There are two pieces of logic fighting each other inside GlobalContextSelector.tsx:

Our Fix: A useEffect hook correctly identifies when the user navigates to a client-only page and tries to collapse all clients (setExpandedClients({})). The log ARCHITECT_DEBUG_STATE_RESET confirms this is running.
A Pre-existing Feature: A separate useEffect hook has the job of ensuring that whenever a client is selected, its entry in the dropdown is automatically expanded for user convenience. The log ARCHITECT_DEBUG_SELECTOR_UI: ... ensuring it's expanded confirms this is also running.
When you navigate to the Chart of Accounts, both hooks fire. Our fix collapses the list, and then the auto-expand feature immediately re-expands it, undoing the fix and causing the bug to persist.

The solution is to make the "auto-expand" feature smarter. It should not run on pages where expansion is irrelevant.

3. Definitive Fix Plan

We will modify the single piece of conflicting logic in client/src/components/dashboard/GlobalContextSelector.tsx.

Remove the Previous useEffect Fix: The state-reset useEffect we added in the last step is causing a conflict. It is a subordinate fix, and we will now address the dominant logic. Please remove the entire useEffect block that watches location.pathname and calls setExpandedClients({}).

Locate the Conflicting "Auto-Expand" Logic: Find the useEffect hook that is responsible for the console message: ARCHITECT_DEBUG_SELECTOR_UI: Selected client changed to ... - ensuring it's expanded. This hook will have selectedClientId in its dependency array and contains a call to setExpandedClients.

Apply a Route-Aware Condition: Inside this hook, you will find the line that expands the client. It will look similar to setExpandedClients(prev => ({ ...prev, [selectedClientId]: true }));. This line is the problem. It must only run when we are on an entity-selection page.

Wrap this line in a condition using the isEntitySelectionView flag we previously established.
The logic must be: "Only automatically expand the selected client IF isEntitySelectionView is true."
Example of the required change:

TypeScript

// Inside the useEffect that depends on [selectedClientId, ...]

// BEFORE:
setExpandedClients(prev => ({ ...prev, [selectedClientId]: true }));

// AFTER:
if (isEntitySelectionView) {
  console.log('ARCHITECT_DEBUG_AUTO_EXPAND: Expanding client on entity-view page.');
  setExpandedClients(prev => ({ ...prev, [selectedClientId]: true }));
}
4. Expected Outcome

A user is on the Journal Entries page.
They navigate to the Chart of Accounts for Client 73.
The GlobalContextSelector re-renders.
The "auto-expand" useEffect hook triggers because selectedClientId changed to 73.
Inside this hook, our new if (isEntitySelectionView) condition will evaluate to false.
The call to setExpandedClients is skipped. The component renders with no clients expanded.
The entity list is not rendered. The phantom checkmark is gone.
This resolves the state conflict at its source. It is the correct and final architectural solution.
