Objective: Begin restructuring the Admin Dashboard (CodeShare/client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx) to incorporate a sequential setup flow and implement the first two steps: Client Setup and Entity Management.

Instructions:

Refactor Dashboard Structure:

Modify CodeShare/client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx.
Introduce state management (e.g., using useState) to track the current activeStep of the setup process (starting at 0).
Add a visual stepper component (use a suitable UI library component or create a custom one) to display the initial prioritized steps:
Client Info
Entities
Summary & Finish Initial Setup (Later steps like Consolidation, CoA, Data Import will be added after this initial flow)
Implement conditional rendering within the dashboard to display specific "Setup Card" components based on the activeStep.
Create ClientSetupCard.tsx (Step 1):

Create a new component file: CodeShare/client/src/components/setup/ClientSetupCard.tsx.
Implement a form to collect initial client/organization details (e.g., Company Name, Admin User info). Reuse existing components like ClientOnboardingForm.tsx if suitable, adapting it into this card structure.
Add form validation using Zod (from CodeShare/client/src/lib/validation.ts).
Implement an onNext function prop. On successful form submission:
Save the client data via a backend API call.
Trigger the parent Dashboard.tsx component to advance the activeStep to 1.
Create EntityManagementCard.tsx (Step 2):

Create a new component file: CodeShare/client/src/components/setup/EntityManagementCard.tsx.
Implement UI for adding one or more entities associated with the client set up in Step 1.
Include fields like Entity Name, Code, Currency (default USD), etc.
Connect this card to the backend API for creating/listing entities.
Ensure the "Next" button/action is only enabled after at least one entity has been successfully created.
Implement an onNext function prop. On completion:
Trigger the parent Dashboard.tsx component to advance the activeStep to 2 (Summary).
Implement an onBack function prop to return to Step 1 (activeStep 0).
Create Initial SetupSummaryCard.tsx (Step 3):

Create a new component file: CodeShare/client/src/components/setup/SetupSummaryCard.tsx.
Display a summary confirming the client details and the entities created.
Add a button like "Finish Initial Setup" or "Activate".
Implement an onComplete function prop. On clicking "Finish":
Potentially make a backend call to mark the initial setup as complete.
Transition the user interface out of the setup flow into the main functional dashboard view.
Implement an onBack function prop to return to Step 2 (activeStep 1).
Completion Criteria:

The Admin Dashboard renders a stepper for the initial setup (Client, Entities, Summary).
The ClientSetupCard allows creating a client and moves to the next step.
The EntityManagementCard allows adding at least one entity and moves to the next step.
The SetupSummaryCard displays basic info and allows finishing the initial setup flow.
