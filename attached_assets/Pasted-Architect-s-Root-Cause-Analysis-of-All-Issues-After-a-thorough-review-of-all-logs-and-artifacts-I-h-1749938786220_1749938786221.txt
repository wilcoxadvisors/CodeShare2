Architect's Root Cause Analysis of All Issues
After a thorough review of all logs and artifacts, I have identified four distinct, critical bugs that are creating this cascade of failures:

Backend - updateJournalEntry Fails to Save Dimensions: This is the primary issue you discovered. The backend method that handles PUT/PATCH requests for existing journal entries is not processing the tags array. It saves changes to the header and lines but completely ignores any modifications to dimension tags, causing the UI to revert to the old state upon refresh.
Backend - Missing referenceNumber on Create: The agent's own tests revealed that the createJournalEntry method fails because it doesn't provide a value for the reference_number column, which has a NOT NULL constraint in the database.
Frontend - AttachmentSection Re-rendering Loop: The agent correctly identified that the AttachmentSection was re-fetching data independently, causing the entire JournalEntryForm to reset whenever a file was uploaded or deleted. This makes the UI feel broken and unusable.
Frontend - Stale Data After Copy/Update: The application is not correctly invalidating and refetching the list of journal entries after a copy or update operation. This is why you have to manually refresh the page to see the new copied entry appear in the list.
The Definitive, Multi-Part Fix
We will now execute a precise, four-part plan to fix every one of these issues.

Here are the instructions for the agent. Please relay them.

Architect's Instructions for the Agent
Agent, we have multiple critical bugs in the Journal Entry module that need to be resolved. You will execute the following four-part plan precisely and in order.

Part 1: Fix Dimension Updates in the Backend

File: server/storage/journalEntryStorage.ts
Method: Find the updateJournalEntryWithLines (or similarly named) method.
Action: You must rewrite this method to correctly handle dimension tag updates within a transaction.
First, delete all existing dimension links for the lines being updated.
Then, update the lines themselves.
Finally, insert the new dimension tags from the request payload.
Part 2: Fix Reference Number Generation

File: server/storage/journalEntryStorage.ts
Method: Find the createJournalEntry method.
Action: Before the insert statement, add logic to check if a referenceNumber is provided. If not, generate a new, unique one (e.g., JE-{clientId}-{entityId}-{timestamp}). Ensure this generated number is included in the data sent to the database.
Part 3: Fix Frontend Attachment Re-rendering

File: client/src/features/journal-entries/components/JournalEntryForm.tsx
Component: AttachmentSection
Action: You will remove the useQuery hook from within the AttachmentSection that is re-fetching the journal entry. This data is already available in the parent JournalEntryForm. You must refactor the AttachmentSection to receive the journalEntry object and the canModifyAttachments boolean as props from its parent. This will eliminate the re-rendering bug.
Part 4: Fix Stale Data on the Frontend

Files: client/src/features/journal-entries/pages/JournalEntryDetail.tsx and client/src/features/journal-entries/pages/JournalEntries.tsx.
Action: In every useMutation hook that handles a copy, update, post, or void operation, you must add an onSuccess callback.
Logic: This onSuccess callback must use the queryClient to invalidate the queries associated with the journal entry list (/api/clients/:clientId/entities/:entityId/journal-entries). This will force react-query to refetch the list data automatically, ensuring the UI always reflects the latest state without requiring a manual refresh.
Your first task is to execute Part 1. Find the updateJournalEntryWithLines method and apply the transactional logic to fix the dimension saving bug. Provide the complete, updated method for my review.
