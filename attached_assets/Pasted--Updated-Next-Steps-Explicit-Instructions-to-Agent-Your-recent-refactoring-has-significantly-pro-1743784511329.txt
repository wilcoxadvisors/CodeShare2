🚩 Updated Next Steps (Explicit Instructions to Agent)
Your recent refactoring has significantly progressed, but the following explicit steps remain clearly incomplete or need explicit verification:

✅ Step 1: Complete and Verify Specialized Storage Modules
Explicitly verify and confirm each of the following storage modules clearly:

 budgetStorage.ts

 userActivityStorage.ts

 formStorage.ts

 assetStorage.ts (fixed assets)

 reportStorage.ts

For each module, clearly confirm:

✅ Proper delegation from storage.ts

✅ Clearly documented interfaces (IBudgetStorage, IUserActivityStorage, etc.)

✅ Clear method documentation and purpose description

✅ No residual database logic remaining in storage.ts

✅ Step 2: Verify and Confirm Interfaces (IStorage)
 Explicitly confirm each newly added specialized storage module clearly reflected in IStorage interface:

typescript
Copy
Edit
export interface IStorage {
  accounts: IAccountStorage;
  clients: IClientStorage;
  entities: IEntityStorage;
  journalEntries: IJournalEntryStorage;
  budgets: IBudgetStorage;
  userActivities: IUserActivityStorage;
  forms: IFormStorage;
  assets: IAssetStorage;
  reports: IReportStorage;
}
 Explicitly verify and confirm proper initialization clearly reflected in both MemStorage and DatabaseStorage.

✅ Step 3: Resolve and Fix Any LSP/TypeScript Errors
 Explicitly fix all LSP/TypeScript errors clearly identified after your recent changes.

 Ensure explicit clean code with zero linting/type errors.

✅ Step 4: Comprehensive Testing
 Explicitly define and clearly set up a test script (npm run test) in package.json:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
 Explicitly ensure all storage modules have clearly written and passing unit tests.

 Run explicit verification of tests passing successfully (npm run test).

✅ Step 5: Final Explicit Documentation Verification
 Explicitly verify every storage module and method has clear, updated documentation.

 Confirm storage.ts explicitly contains only delegation logic, no residual database logic.

📋 Agent’s Expected Reporting (Clearly Defined Format)
Your explicit report back to me should follow this exact format clearly:

## ✅ Updated Verification Report

### Specialized Storage Modules Verification:
- `budgetStorage.ts`: ✅ Verified delegation, documentation, and interfaces.
- `userActivityStorage.ts`: ✅ Verified delegation, documentation, and interfaces.
- `formStorage.ts`: ✅ Verified delegation, documentation, and interfaces.
- `assetStorage.ts`: ✅ Verified delegation, documentation, and interfaces.
- `reportStorage.ts`: ✅ Verified delegation, documentation, and interfaces.

### IStorage Interface & Initialization:
- ✅ All modules clearly reflected in `IStorage`.
- ✅ Verified initialization in `MemStorage` and `DatabaseStorage`.

### LSP/TypeScript Errors:
- ✅ All LSP and TypeScript errors explicitly resolved.

### Comprehensive Tests:
- ✅ Test script clearly defined in `package.json`.
- ✅ All tests passing explicitly.

### Documentation Verification:
- ✅ All modules and methods explicitly verified and documented.

---

### Final Status:
✅ All explicitly defined issues resolved and verified.
