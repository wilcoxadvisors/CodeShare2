Task Assignment: Verify CoA Stability at Commit 64447303 (Step 4: Add Account Verification)

Context:
We are verifying the stability of the CoA module at commit 64447303. Steps 1 (Template & Seeding), 2 (API), and 3 (Display) have passed. We now need to verify the core "Add Account" functionality via the UI.

Goal:
Verify that the "Add Account" feature (accessed via the Chart of Accounts page UI) works correctly, allowing users to add a new account which is then persisted to the database.

Instructions (Step 4 of Verification Plan):

Action: Add Logging (Optional but Recommended):

Consider adding temporary, clearly labeled console.log statements to trace the "Add Account" flow:
Frontend (ChartOfAccounts.tsx): Inside the form submission handler (e.g., handleSubmit or handleAddAccount) and the useCreateAccount mutation hook (or equivalent). Log the account data being submitted.
Backend (server/accountRoutes.ts): Inside the POST /api/clients/:clientId/accounts route handler. Log the req.body.
Backend (server/storage.ts): Inside the createAccount storage function. Log the input data and the result of the database insertion.
Action: Test "Add Account" via UI Simulation:

Ensure the application is running (npm run dev) and you are logged in as admin (admin/password123).
Use the web application tool to navigate to the Chart of Accounts page for a test client (e.g., Client ID 128).
Simulate clicking the "Add Account" button.
Simulate filling out the required fields in the form (e.g., accountCode, accountName, accountType, select a parentId). Use unique data for easy identification (e.g., accountCode: "TESTADD99").
Simulate submitting the form.
Action: Analyze Results & Logs:

Observe UI: Did the form submission appear successful in the UI? Did the new account appear in the CoA list/tree immediately (or after a refresh)? Note any UI error messages.
Check Frontend Logs: Review browser console logs for errors during form submission or data processing.
Check Backend Logs: Review server logs for the API request (POST .../accounts), the data received, the execution of the createAccount storage function, and any database errors.
Check Database: Directly query the database to confirm the new account ("TESTADD99") was created correctly for the specific client ID: psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE client_id = <client_id> AND account_code = 'TESTADD99';".
Verification:

The "Add Account" form can be submitted successfully via the UI.
No critical errors occur in the frontend or backend logs during the process.
The new account record is correctly created and persisted in the database.
The UI updates (eventually) to show the newly added account.
Reporting:

Report PASS/FAIL for the "Add Account" Verification (Step 4).
Describe the UI behavior during the test (form submission, success/error messages).
Provide relevant snippets from frontend and backend logs, especially if errors occurred.
Include the result of the direct database query confirming the account creation.
Await confirmation before proceeding to Step 5 (UI/UX Button Verification).
