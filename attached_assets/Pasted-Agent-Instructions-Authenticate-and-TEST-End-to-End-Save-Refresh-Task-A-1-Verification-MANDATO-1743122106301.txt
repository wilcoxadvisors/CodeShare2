Agent Instructions: Authenticate and TEST End-to-End Save & Refresh (Task A.1 Verification - MANDATORY)

Goal: Log in as the admin user (admin/password123) and execute the full "Add Client" flow to verify Task A.1 (Final Save & Dashboard Update) using the detailed logs you added in Checkpoint 9ff19aef.

Context: You have added the necessary logging. You have the admin credentials. You MUST now perform the test yourself. Do NOT ask the user to test this step.

Steps:

Authenticate:
Action: Programmatically authenticate using the credentials: Username: admin, Password: password123.
Method: Identify the login API endpoint (e.g., /api/auth/login). Send a POST request (e.g., using Workspace within a test script or directly if possible) with the credentials. Capture and store the session cookie(s) returned. Confirm authentication success (e.g., expect a 200 OK response).
Apply Session: Ensure all subsequent simulated browser actions or API calls use the obtained session cookie(s) in their request headers.
Report: Briefly state if authentication was successful. If not, report the error and STOP.
Execute Full Test Flow (No Edits/Updates):
Action: Once authenticated, simulate navigating to the Admin Dashboard.
Action: Simulate clicking "Add Client".
Action: Go through the setup flow (Steps 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> Finish).
Action: In Step 2, add one or two entities but do NOT attempt to update or edit them.
Action: Click "Finish & Add Client" in Step 3.
Collect Logs and Observe Results:
Action: Collect ALL "DEBUG:" log messages from the Frontend Console related to handleCompleteSetup and handleSetupComplete.
Action: Simulate checking the Network Results: Report status codes for POST /api/admin/clients, POST /api/admin/entities, and the dashboard data refetch request.
Action: Check relevant Backend Console logs for API route hits, received data, database interactions/errors.
Action: Check UI State: Did the modal close state change? Did the dashboard data state update?
Report Detailed Findings:
Action: Provide the complete sequence of collected frontend and backend "DEBUG:" logs.
Action: Report the final HTTP status codes from the simulated network requests.
Action: State clearly whether the simulated modal closed and whether the simulated dashboard data updated correctly.
Action: Note any errors encountered during the test flow.
The agent must complete this entire verification process and report the detailed results.
