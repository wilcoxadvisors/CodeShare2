Task Assignment: Debug and Fix api-journal-entries.js Test Script Execution

Context: The storage.createJournalEntry function has been updated to handle createdById. However, the verification test script test/api-journal-entries.js is still failing due to authentication/cookie issues or other errors identified during previous attempts (potentially related to addJournalEntryLine or list endpoint validation).

Goal: Diagnose and resolve the errors preventing test/api-journal-entries.js from running successfully, ensuring all steps within the script pass.

Instructions:

Action: Re-run Test Script & Identify Error:

Ensure the server is running.
Navigate to the test directory: cd test
Execute the API test script:
Bash

node api-journal-entries.js
Carefully examine the first error reported in the output that causes the script to fail or report a test failure.
Action: Diagnose and Fix Reported Error:

Based on the specific error identified in Step 1, investigate the cause. This might involve:
Auth/Cookie Issues: Re-checking cookie parsing/handling logic within test/api-journal-entries.js (specifically the login and getCookieHeader functions) or ensuring cookies.txt is generated correctly by scripts/login.js. Verify credentials used (admin/password123) match the database.
addJournalEntryLine vs. createJournalEntryLine: If the error relates to adding lines, ensure the correct function name is used consistently between server/journalEntryRoutes.ts and server/storage.ts (either rename in the route or ensure the alias addJournalEntryLine in DatabaseStorage and MemStorage is correct).
List Endpoint Validation/Filtering: If the error occurs during the "List Journal Entries" test, re-examine the query parameter parsing and Zod validation (listJournalEntriesFiltersSchema) logic within the GET /api/clients/:clientId/journal-entries route handler in server/journalEntryRoutes.ts. Ensure numeric parameters are correctly parsed.
Other Errors: Address any other specific errors reported (e.g., TypeErrors, ReferenceErrors).
Action: Repeat Testing and Fixing:

After applying a fix for the identified error, repeat Step 1 (re-run the test script node api-journal-entries.js).
If the script still fails, identify the new first error and repeat Step 2 (diagnose and fix).
Continue this cycle until the script runs to completion and all test steps report PASS.
Verification:

The test/api-journal-entries.js script executes completely without any runtime errors.
All test steps within the script (POST valid/invalid, GET list, GET specific, PUT, DELETE) report PASS in the script's output.
Reporting:

Describe the specific errors encountered while running the test script.
Detail the fixes applied to resolve each error (mentioning the files changed).
Report the final, successful output of the node test/api-journal-entries.js execution, clearly stating that all tests passed.
