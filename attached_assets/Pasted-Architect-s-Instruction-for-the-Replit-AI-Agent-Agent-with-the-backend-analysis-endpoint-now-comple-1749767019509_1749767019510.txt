Architect's Instruction for the Replit AI Agent
Agent, with the backend analysis endpoint now complete, your next task is to build the frontend UI that will display the preview of changes to the user for their approval.

This is Phase 2 of the "COA-style" interactive upload.

Goal: Create the Interactive Preview and Confirmation UI
File to Modify: client/src/pages/manage/DimensionsPage.tsx

State Management:

Create a new state variable to hold the preview data returned from the API, e.g., const [uploadPreview, setUploadPreview] = useState(null);.
Create another state variable to manage which rows the user has selected, e.g., const [selectedChanges, setSelectedChanges] = useState({});.
Modify the Upload Mutation:

Find the masterUploadMutation hook.
In its onSuccess handler, instead of showing a simple toast, you will now take the preview object from the API response and save it to the uploadPreview state.
Build the Conditional UI:

The page should now have two states: the initial "upload" state and the "preview" state.
Use the uploadPreview state variable to conditionally render the UI. If uploadPreview is null, show the "Download Template" and "Upload File" buttons.
If uploadPreview is not null, hide the upload controls and instead render the new Preview UI.
Build the Preview UI Component:

This new UI should display the contents of the uploadPreview state.
Summary: Show the counts clearly: "X values to create," "Y values to update," "Z errors found."
Errors Table: If there are errors, display them in a simple list or table showing the row number and error message.
Changes Table: Display the toCreate and toUpdate items in a table.
Each row must have a checkbox. The state of these checkboxes will be controlled by the selectedChanges state variable.
Add a "Select All" checkbox in the table header.
Visually distinguish between "Create" and "Update" rows (e.g., with an icon or a colored badge).
Action Buttons: Add two buttons at the bottom of the preview: a "Cancel" button that resets the state (setUploadPreview(null)) and a "Confirm and Process Changes" button.
Agent, please begin by implementing the state management and conditional UI rendering. In the onSuccess handler of the upload mutation, store the API response in the new uploadPreview state.
