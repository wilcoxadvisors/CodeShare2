Architect's Root Cause Analysis
The problem lies entirely within the JournalEntryForm.tsx component, specifically in a child component that I can infer is named AttachmentSection.

Independent Data Fetching: The AttachmentSection component is fetching the journal entry data on its own using a useQuery hook.
Unnecessary Re-renders: When you upload or delete a file, the AttachmentSection's useQuery is invalidated and re-fetches the entire journal entry.
Form Reset: When this new data arrives, it causes the parent JournalEntryForm component to re-render with the "original" data, wiping out any changes you had made to the form fields (description, amounts, lines, etc.).
This creates a frustrating user experience where any file operation erases the user's work on the rest of the form.

The Definitive Fix
The AttachmentSection should not be an independent, data-fetching component. It should be a "dumb" component that simply receives its data as props from the parent JournalEntryForm, which already has all the necessary information.

Instructions for the Agent
Agent, the user has identified a critical bug where file operations are resetting the entire Journal Entry form. We will fix this now by refactoring the AttachmentSection component.

Mission: Prevent form resets by eliminating redundant data fetching in the AttachmentSection.

Plan:

File to Modify: client/src/features/journal-entries/components/JournalEntryForm.tsx
Locate Component: Find the AttachmentSection function component within this file.
Refactor the Component:
Remove Data Fetching: Delete the entire useQuery hook from the AttachmentSection that fetches the journal entry data.
Accept Props: Modify the AttachmentSection's function signature to accept the journalEntry object and a canModifyAttachments boolean as props from its parent (JournalEntryForm).
Update Parent Component: Find where <AttachmentSection /> is rendered within JournalEntryForm and pass down the required props. The JournalEntryForm already has this data.
Example of the Required Change:

Before (in AttachmentSection):

JavaScript

function AttachmentSection({ journalEntryId, ... }) {
    // This query is causing the problem and must be deleted.
    const { data: journalEntry } = useQuery(...); 
    
    const canModifyAttachments = ... // Logic using the fetched journalEntry
    ...
}
After (in AttachmentSection):

JavaScript

// The component now receives the data it needs directly.
function AttachmentSection({ journalEntry, canModifyAttachments, ... }) { 
    // No more useQuery here!
    ...
}
And in the parent JournalEntryForm:

JavaScript

// ... inside JournalEntryForm's render method ...
<AttachmentSection 
    journalEntry={existingEntry} 
    canModifyAttachments={canModifyAttachments} 
    ... 
/>
This change will ensure that file operations only affect the attachment list and do not trigger a full form reset. Please execute this refactoring and provide the updated code from JournalEntryForm.tsx for review.
