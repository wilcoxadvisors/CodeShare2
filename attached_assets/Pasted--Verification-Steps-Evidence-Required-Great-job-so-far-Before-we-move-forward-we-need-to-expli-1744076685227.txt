✅ Verification Steps & Evidence Required

Great job so far. Before we move forward, we need to explicitly confirm the following steps to ensure all cleanup and structural adjustments are fully completed and correctly implemented. Please explicitly verify each of these items individually and provide evidence (screenshots or exact console outputs):

Step-by-step Explicit Confirmation:
✅ Confirm Import Paths

Explicitly verify that all import paths in the following files now use only @/ aliases:

client/src/App.tsx

client/src/features/journal-entries/pages/JournalEntries.tsx

client/src/features/journal-entries/pages/NewJournalEntry.tsx

client/src/features/journal-entries/pages/JournalEntryDetail.tsx

client/src/features/journal-entries/pages/BatchUpload.tsx

client/src/features/journal-entries/components/JournalEntryForm.tsx

✅ Confirm Removal of Old Files

Explicitly verify that the following old journal entry files no longer exist in the project:

client/src/pages/JournalEntries.tsx

client/src/pages/JournalEntryDetail.tsx

client/src/pages/NewJournalEntry.tsx

client/src/pages/BatchUpload.tsx

client/src/components/ManualJournalEntry.tsx

client/src/components/BatchJournalUpload.tsx

client/src/components/JournalEntryForm.tsx

client/src/components/journal/* (entire folder)

✅ Confirm No Unused Exports or Components

Explicitly run npx ts-prune and npx knip again, ensuring these commands execute successfully.

Clearly show their output confirming no unused files, exports, or components remain in the journal-entries feature or elsewhere related.

✅ Confirm Application Stability

Explicitly restart the development application.

Provide clear evidence (screenshot or log) explicitly confirming the application starts without errors or warnings.

Confirm explicitly that the journal entry functionality (listing, creating new entries, batch uploads) is working without runtime errors.

Important:
Do not proceed with other enhancements or functionalities until each of the above items is explicitly verified and confirmed with provided evidence.
