Architect's Definitive Plan: Diagnose and Repair the Client-Server Data Flow

1. Goal:

Diagnose the exact validation error by modifying the frontend API client to log the server's full error response. Then, use this information to permanently fix the data payload construction in JournalEntryForm.tsx so that saving a journal entry works flawlessly.

2. Definitive Plan:

Stage 1: Expose the Server-Side Validation Error

Objective: Our apiRequest utility is likely hiding the detailed JSON error that the server sends back on a 400 Bad Request. We need to see this error.

File to Modify: client/src/lib/queryClient.ts

Action:

Locate the throwIfResNotOk function. It is too generic.
We will modify it to first try and parse a JSON error payload from the response body before throwing an error. This will give us the detailed validation errors from the server.
Replace the existing throwIfResNotOk function with this enhanced version:
TypeScript

// In client/src/lib/queryClient.ts
// REPLACE the existing throwIfResNotOk function with this:
async function throwIfResNotOk(res: Response) {
  if (!res.ok) {
    let errorPayload;
    try {
      // The server often sends detailed validation errors in a JSON body
      errorPayload = await res.json();
      console.error("SERVER REJECTED PAYLOAD:", errorPayload);
    } catch (e) {
      // If the body is not JSON, use the raw text
      errorPayload = await res.text();
    }
    // Throw an error that includes the detailed payload
    throw new Error(`${res.status} ${res.statusText}: ${JSON.stringify(errorPayload, null, 2)}`);
  }
}
Note: The agent may need to adjust the apiRequest function itself if throwIfResNotOk is not present, but the principle is the same: find the if (!res.ok) block and ensure it logs the JSON body of the error response.

Stage 2: Trigger and Capture the Error

Objective: With the logging in place, we need to trigger the error to capture the root cause.
Action for the User/Agent:
Restart the application to ensure the changes from Stage 1 are active.
Navigate to the "New Journal Entry" page.
Fill out the form with the minimum required valid data (e.g., date, reference, two balanced lines with accounts).
Attempt to click "Save Draft".
The operation will fail, but this time, the browser's developer console will contain a new, detailed error message logged by our modified code.
Provide me with this new, full console log.
Stage 3: Implement the Definitive Fix

Objective: Once I have the detailed error from the server, I will provide a final, surgical instruction to fix the data payload construction in JournalEntryForm.tsx. This is pending the result of Stage 2.
