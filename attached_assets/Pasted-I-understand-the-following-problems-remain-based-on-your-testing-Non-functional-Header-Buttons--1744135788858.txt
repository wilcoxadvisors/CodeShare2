I understand the following problems remain based on your testing:



Non-functional Header Buttons: "Create Entry" and "Batch Upload" buttons in the main header need removal.

JE List - ID Display: Shows an ID like "#80" â€“ we need to confirm if this is the correct database id as intended by your previous fix or something else.

JE List - Amounts: Shows "$0.00" instead of differentiating Total Debits and Credits.

Reference Field (Detail/Edit): Still appearing blank despite the attempt to fix the form binding.

Edit Form - Account Lines: Account lines are blank when editing an existing entry.

Workflow Buttons:"Submit for approval" doesn't work from the detail page (presumably when viewing a draft).

Only "Save [as Draft]" is available during edit, no option to "Post".





Remove Header Buttons: I'll find the main application layout component (likely App.tsx or a dedicated Header.tsx) and identify where these buttons are rendered to guide their removal.

Fix JE List Page (JournalEntries.tsx):Verify the ID column displays the correct journalEntry.id.

Update the "Amount" column to show separate "Total Debit" and "Total Credit" values. I'll need to analyze how the list data is fetched and processed in JournalEntries.tsx.

Revisit Reference Field: I'll re-examine JournalEntryDetail.tsx and JournalEntryForm.tsx focusing on:How the referenceNumber is fetched/passed to the detail view.

How the referenceNumber state is managed and bound in the form during create and edit modes.

Fix Edit Form Blank Account Lines: I'll analyze JournalEntryForm.tsx specifically in edit mode. This involves checking how existingEntry data (loaded via useEditJournalEntry) is used to populate the line item inputs.

Implement/Fix Workflow Buttons:Detail Page: Examine the button rendering logic in JournalEntryDetail.tsx based on the entry status. Add/connect the API call for "Submit for Approval".

Edit/Create Form: Modify JournalEntryForm.tsx to potentially include a "Post" button (perhaps conditionally based on status or permissions) alongside "Save as Draft".

Backend: Verify the necessary API endpoints (/submit, /approve, /post) exist and function correctly in journalEntryRoutes.ts.
