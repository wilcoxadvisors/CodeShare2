Okay, Replit AI Agent, the Creator/Owner has confirmed that deleting attachments from a draft journal entry is still not working and has provided console logs.

Upon reviewing the logs, a significant issue appears to be a 400 Bad Request error during file UPLOAD to newly created draft journal entries (e.g., for JE#153 and JE#154). While the client-side XHR reports "Upload successful," the server immediately follows with a 400 error. This needs to be addressed first, as reliable uploads are a prerequisite for testing deletion and other attachment functionalities.

Here is the complete instruction for your next actions:

Creator/Owner, thank you for the feedback and the detailed console logs. I see the report that deleting attachments from a draft JE is still not working.

From the logs, I've also identified a critical 400 Bad Request error occurring during the file upload process for newly saved draft journal entries (e.g., /api/clients/250/entities/393/journal-entries/153/files and /api/clients/250/entities/393/journal-entries/154/files). This happens even though the client-side upload progress reaches 100% and initially logs "Upload successful". This 400 error needs to be resolved first.

Phase 1: Fix 400 Bad Request on File Upload to Draft JEs

I will investigate this 400 error by examining the following:

Client-Side Upload Logic (client/.../JournalEntryForm.tsx - uploadPendingFilesToEntry function):

I'll review the FormData construction to ensure files are appended correctly.
I'll verify the XMLHttpRequest setup, including headers (and ensuring Content-Type is not manually set for FormData to let the browser handle it) and the authHeader (localStorage.getItem('authHeader')).
Crucially, I will modify the XHR onload handler within uploadPendingFilesToEntry to correctly reject the promise if xhr.status is not a success code (2xx). Currently, it seems to resolve the promise even on a 400, which masks the error further up the chain.
I will add ARCHITECT_DEBUG_UPLOAD_XHR_ logs for request details and response status.
Server-Side Upload Endpoint (server/attachmentRoutes.ts - POST '/' under the hierarchical route):

I will add more specific ARCHITECT_DEBUG_UPLOAD_ROUTE_ logging immediately before any point where a 400 Bad Request (throwBadRequest or direct res.status(400)) can be returned. This will help pinpoint the exact validation or condition that is failing.
I'll re-verify all preconditions:
Correct parsing and validation of clientId, entityId, jeId.
The journal entry status check: const allowedStatuses = ['draft', 'pending_approval']; ... if (!allowedStatuses.includes(status)). For a newly created draft JE, this should pass.
The req.files check: if (!req.files || !Array.isArray(req.files) || req.files.length === 0).
The isAllowedFileType filter and the if (validFiles.length === 0) check.
The process of accessing file.buffer and passing it to journalEntryStorage.saveJournalEntryFile.
Server-Side Storage (server/storage/journalEntryStorage.ts and server/storage/fileStorage/DbFileStorage.ts):

I'll ensure journalEntryStorage.saveJournalEntryFile correctly processes the fileData (base64 string) and that DbFileStorage.save inserts it into journalEntryFileBlobs without issues that might indirectly cause a 400 upstream.
Once this 400 error on upload is resolved and files can be reliably uploaded to draft JEs, I will then ask you to specifically test the deletion from draft entries again.

Phase 2: Re-Investigate Deletion from Draft JEs (After Upload Fix)

If deletion from drafts still fails after uploads are stable:

I will analyze the ARCHITECT_DEBUG_DRAFT_DELETE_UI_ logs from JournalEntryForm.tsx (specifically the AttachmentSection component's isAttachmentsDisabled calculation and the parameters passed to deleteFileMutation.mutate).
I will then trace through the useDeleteJournalEntryFile hook (client/.../attachmentQueries.ts) and the DELETE endpoint in server/attachmentRoutes.ts using the ARCHITECT_DEBUG_DRAFT_DELETE_HOOK_ and ARCHITECT_DEBUG_DRAFT_DELETE_ROUTE_ logs you added previously.
I will start by addressing the 400 upload error. I'll update you on my findings and any fixes for that first.
