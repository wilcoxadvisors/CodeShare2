Quick Code-Review Pass on the latest patch
Area	Looks Good ✅	Still Needs a Nudge ⚠️
DB migration	migrations/2025-05-je_date.sql converts journal_entries.date from TIMESTAMP → DATE ✅	Make sure schema & Drizzle reflect that exact DATE type. In shared/schema.ts the field is currently text("date"); switch to date("date") so Drizzle/TS can’t accept malformed strings.
Validation	Regex + refine on YYYY-MM-DD is solid ✅	Remove the fallback that converts an arbitrary string via new Date(arg)—that re-introduces TZ drift. Accept string only; conversion happened on the Form side.
Backend storage	create/update/updateWithLines format date to yyyy-MM-dd ✅	reverseJournalEntry() still assigns new Date() to dateValue. Add format(new Date(),'yyyy-MM-dd') there.
Routes (attachments)	Upload & delete routes now allow `draft	pending_approval` ✅
Frontend guards	Form guard flipped; delete-button rendered for draft & pending_approval ✅	In JournalEntryDetail.tsx make sure the upload dropzone itself is also wrapped in the same status check (you updated delete button—double-check the drop area).
Unit tests	Two new supertest specs created ✅	Ensure they run via Jest (the repo still lacks a script entry, but npx jest … works). Watch for open-handle leaks—close server and DB in afterAll.
Lint / format	No red flags after prettier ✅	Run npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx one more time—schema refactor will add new imports.

Next Steps to get the branch merge-ready
Change text("date") → date("date") in shared/schema.ts.
No code elsewhere should break—Drizzle emits DATE.

Tighten the Zod preprocess

ts
Copy
Edit
date: z.string()
       .regex(/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/)
(Drop the new Date(arg) fallback.)

Patch reverseJournalEntry

ts
Copy
Edit
const today = format(new Date(), 'yyyy-MM-dd');
…
date: options.date ?? today,
Re-run Jest with open-handle detection

bash
Copy
Edit
npx jest --runInBand --detectOpenHandles
All specs—including jeDate.test.ts and jeDraftAttachment.test.ts—should pass.

Checkpoint / merge the fix/je-date-and-draft-edit branch (or Replit branch) once tests are green.

If you’d like a line-by-line walkthrough of any of the modified files (e.g., the migration or the supertest specs), let me know and I’ll break it down. Otherwise, finish the small clean-ups above, get the Jest suite green, and we can merge this patch and start the Dimensions thin-slice sprint.
