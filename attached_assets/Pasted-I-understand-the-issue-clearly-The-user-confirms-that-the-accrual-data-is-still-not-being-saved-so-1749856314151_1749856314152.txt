âœ“ Fixed accrual settings preservation with user modification tracking
âœ“ Added comprehensive debugging throughout the data flow
âœ“ Implemented Switch and Calendar handlers that prevent overwriting
âœ“ Created dedicated useEffect hook for accrual settings preservation
âœ“ Added form submission debugging to track data integrity

The automatic accrual reversals feature should now properly preserve user input. When you toggle the accrual switch or select a reversal date, those settings should stay intact and be included in the form submission. Can you test creating or editing a journal entry with accrual settings to confirm it's working correctly?

okay when i created a journal entry and posted with the accural it worked but if i did it from editing a journal entry it did not work. The calendar is still a issue. I select June 1 and may 31st populates so i have to select June 2nd to get June 1st.

I see two distinct issues to fix:

Editing existing entries: The accrual settings aren't being preserved when editing
Calendar date issue: Off-by-one date selection problem
Let me fix both issues systematically.


Opened client/src/features/journal-entries/components/JournalEntryForm.tsx
I'm now fixing both the calendar date issue and the editing functionality for accrual settings.

First, let me fix the calendar date selection issue by correcting the date parsing:

                <PopoverContent className="w-auto p-0">

                    mode="single"
                    selected={journalData.reversalDate ? new Date(journalData.reversalDate) : undefined}
                    selected={journalData.reversalDate ? new Date(journalData.reversalDate + 'T12:00:00') : undefined}
                    onSelect={(date) => {
                      console.log("ARCHITECT_DEBUG_REVERSAL_DATE_CHANGE: User selecting reversal date:", date);
                      setUserHasModifiedAccrual(true); // Mark that user has manually changed accrual settings
Now I'm fixing the date formatting issue by using a proper local date conversion instead of adding a time component:

                    selected={journalData.reversalDate ? new Date(journalData.reversalDate + 'T12:00:00') : undefined}
                    selected={journalData.reversalDate ? (() => {
                      const [year, month, day] = journalData.reversalDate.split('-');
                      return new Date(parseInt(year), parseInt(month) - 1, parseInt(day));
                    })() : undefined}
                    onSelect={(date) => {
                      console.log("ARCHITECT_DEBUG_REVERSAL_DATE_CHANGE: User selecting reversal date:", date);
                      setUserHasModifiedAccrual(true); // Mark that user has manually changed accrual settings
Now I need to fix the issue with editing existing journal entries where accrual settings aren't being preserved. Let me check how the existing entry data is being passed and ensure the accrual preservation logic works correctly.

  }

Accrual settings will be preserved when editing existing journal entries
Can you test both creating a new accrual entry and editing an existing one to confirm the fixes are working properly?
