Task: Debug and Fix CoA Import Logic in server/storage.ts

Review importCoaForClient Logic:
Action: Carefully re-examine the entire importCoaForClient function in server/storage.ts.
Focus Areas:
Case Sensitivity: Verify that mapping from CSV headers (e.g., CODE, ParentCODE from your test file) to database fields is handled correctly and consistently case-insensitively. Double-check the usage of normalizeCsvHeaders and getCaseInsensitiveValue helper functions.
Parent Account Resolution: Scrutinize the two-pass logic for updating parentId. Does it correctly find the parent's ID based on ParentAccountNumber after the first insertion pass? How are errors handled if a ParentAccountNumber in the file doesn't correspond to any account number created in the first pass?
Data Integrity Checks: Review the logic added to handle existing accounts (checking accountHasTransactions, updating allowed fields, or inactivating). Is this logic correctly implemented within the transaction? Does it correctly differentiate between creating new accounts and updating existing ones found in the import file?
Transaction Scope: Confirm that the entire process – deleting old accounts (if that's still the strategy), inserting new accounts (pass 1), updating parent IDs (pass 2), handling existing accounts – is enclosed within a single database transaction (db.transaction(...)) that will fully roll back if any error occurs during validation or database operations.
Error Handling & Logging: Ensure that validation errors (duplicate account numbers within the file, invalid account types, missing required fields, unresolved parent accounts) and database errors are caught properly within the function, and that informative error messages are generated and propagated back to the API caller. Add more detailed logging within this function if needed to trace data during processing.
Implement Fixes:
Action: Apply necessary corrections to the importCoaForClient function in server/storage.ts based on your review to address potential bugs in case handling, parent resolution, data integrity logic, transaction management, or error handling.
Report Changes:
Action: Describe the specific issues you identified during the review and detail the fixes you implemented in server/storage.ts.
