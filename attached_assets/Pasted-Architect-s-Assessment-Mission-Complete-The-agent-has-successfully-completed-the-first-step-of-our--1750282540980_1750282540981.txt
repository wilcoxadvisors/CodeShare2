Architect's Assessment: Mission Complete
The agent has successfully completed the first step of our refactoring mission.

Verification: The JournalEntryHeader.tsx component has been successfully created. The JSX for the header has been correctly migrated, and the parent JournalEntryForm.tsx now correctly imports and renders this new component.
Outcome: The primary goal has been achieved. The JournalEntryForm component is now smaller and more focused, and the header logic is properly encapsulated. This is a successful and crucial first step.
The agent's work is approved. We will proceed immediately to the next, most critical part of the decomposition.

Architect's Mission: Decompose the Journal Entry Form
Phase 1, Step 2: Extract JournalEntryLinesTable Component

1. Goal:

Continue the decomposition of JournalEntryForm.tsx by extracting the entire lines table—the most complex piece of the form—into its own dedicated JournalEntryLinesTable component.

2. Definitive Plan:

Create New File:

Create a new file at: client/src/features/journal-entries/components/JournalEntryLinesTable.tsx.
Define Component and Props:

Create a React component named JournalEntryLinesTable.
This component will manage the state and rendering of the JE lines. Define a props interface that accepts the following from JournalEntryForm:
lines and setLines (the state for the line items).
accounts, entities, and dimensions (the data needed for the dropdowns).
fieldErrors (for displaying validation errors on specific lines).
isBalanced (to display the balance status).
totalDebit and totalCredit (for the footer totals).
Migrate JSX and Logic:

Cut the entire <table> element and its surrounding <div> from JournalEntryForm.tsx. This includes the header, body, and footer of the table. Paste this into JournalEntryLinesTable.tsx.
Move all related logic from JournalEntryForm.tsx into JournalEntryLinesTable.tsx. This is critical and includes:
The state for the line-item popovers (expandedAccounts, tagPopoverOpen, etc.).
The handler functions: handleLineChange, addLine, removeLine, updateLineTags, etc.
The useMemo hooks used to calculate totalDebit, totalCredit, and entityBalances.
Refactor JournalEntryForm.tsx:

In JournalEntryForm.tsx, import the new JournalEntryLinesTable component.
Render the new component where the table used to be, passing down the necessary state as props. JournalEntryForm will now primarily be responsible for the overall form state and submission logic, delegating the complex line-item management to the new component.
5. Expected Outcome:

The JournalEntryForm.tsx component will be dramatically simplified, acting more as a controller for its child components.
The new JournalEntryLinesTable.tsx will encapsulate all the complexity of the data grid, making it easier to manage, debug, and enhance in the future.
The application's functionality will remain identical to the user.
