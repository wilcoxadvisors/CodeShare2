The user is still getting a 400 error when trying to update only the name (or other allowed fields) on an account with transactions (like ID 7962), even after the latest changes (Checkpoint 80bce460). We need to trace the data precisely during the failed attempt.

Task: Verify logging and re-run the failing test scenario.

Verify/Re-add Frontend Logging:

Go back to client/src/pages/ChartOfAccounts.tsx.
Find the submit handler function for updating an account.
Ensure that immediately before the updateAccount.mutateAsync(...) call, there is a log statement that outputs the final payload object being sent. This log must come after any logic that filters for changed fields or excludes accountCode/type. Use this exact format:
TypeScript

console.log('CRITICAL DEBUG: Final FE Payload Sent:', JSON.stringify(payloadBeingSentToMutate, null, 2));
updateAccount.mutateAsync(payloadBeingSentToMutate);
(Replace payloadBeingSentToMutate with the actual variable name used).
Verify Backend Logging:

Go back to server/accountRoutes.ts.
Find the PUT /api/clients/:clientId/accounts/:id route handler.
Ensure the following logs are present and active:
Right at the beginning of the handler:
TypeScript

console.log('CRITICAL DEBUG: BE Received req.body:', JSON.stringify(req.body, null, 2));
Just before calling storage.accounts.updateAccount(...):
TypeScript

console.log('CRITICAL DEBUG: BE Data to Storage:', JSON.stringify(updateDataWithCorrectType, null, 2));
(Adjust variable names if necessary).
Re-run Test:

Ask the user (or attempt yourself) to repeat the exact action that causes the 400 error: Edit account 7962 (which has transactions), change only the name field, and click Save/Update.
Report Findings (Crucial):

Provide the output from the CRITICAL DEBUG: Final FE Payload Sent: log in the browser console.
Provide the output from the CRITICAL DEBUG: BE Received req.body: log in the server console.
Provide the output from the CRITICAL DEBUG: BE Data to Storage: log in the server console (it might not reach this point if the error occurs earlier in the route handler).
Provide the exact 400 Bad Request error response shown in the browser's Network tab (including the response body/message).
Goal: By comparing these three specific logs (Frontend Sent Payload, Backend Received Body, Backend Data to Storage) for the failing request, we should be able to see exactly where the forbidden fields (accountCode or type) are incorrectly persisting in the data and triggering the backend's (correct) validation block."
