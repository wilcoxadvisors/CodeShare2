Task Assignment: Perform FINAL UI Verification via Web Tool (Agent Task - MANDATORY - Attempt 3)

Context:
The code to accountCode refactoring is complete. API checks confirm correct data is served. Attempts at scripted UI verification failed. The agent must now use its direct web observation capabilities ("web application feedback tool"/screenshot tool) to perform the final visual verification. The tsc check remains unresolved (timeout issues).

Goal:
Confirm via direct observation using the web application tool that the Chart of Accounts data displays correctly for both a newly created client and an existing client.

Instructions:

Part 1: Verify New Client CoA Display via Web Tool

Action: Ensure Application is Running & Logged In:

Verify the application is running (npm run dev).
Ensure you are logged in as admin (admin / password123).
Action: Navigate & Observe New Client CoA via Web Tool:

Use the web application tool to simulate navigating to the Chart of Accounts page for the new client (ID 100).
Observe & Report: Look at the UI rendered in the tool. Does the Chart of Accounts data display correctly? Is the table populated with accounts showing accountCode? Is the hierarchy visible and expanded? Describe what you see in the tool's view. Capture a final screenshot using the tool as evidence.
Part 2: Verify Existing Client CoA Display via Web Tool

Action: Navigate & Observe Existing Client CoA via Web Tool:
Use the web application tool to simulate navigating to the Chart of Accounts page for an existing client (e.g., Client ID 1).
Observe & Report: Look at the UI rendered in the tool. Does the Chart of Accounts data display correctly? Is the hierarchy visible and expanded? Describe what you see in the tool's view. Capture a final screenshot using the tool as evidence.
Verification:

Confirm based on direct observation via the web tool that CoA data is visible and correct in the UI for the newly created client (ID 100).
Confirm based on direct observation via the web tool that CoA data is visible and correct in the UI for the existing client (e.g., Client ID 1).
Reporting:

Report PASS/FAIL for the New Client UI Verification (Step 2), including a description of the observed UI state via the tool and the final screenshot.
Report PASS/FAIL for the Existing Client UI Verification (Step 3), including a description of the observed UI state via the tool and the final screenshot.
Note the status of the tsc --noEmit check (still unresolved/timing out).
If both UI verifications PASS based on your direct observation, explicitly state that the original "CoA data not displaying" bug IS RESOLVED and Task B.1 (Chart of Accounts) is functionally complete and verified.
