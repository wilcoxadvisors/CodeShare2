Architect's Assessment and Next Steps
Testing Framework: Complete. The agent has successfully set up the file structure and configuration for Property-Based Testing (fast-check), Mutation Testing (Stryker), Visual Regression Testing (Cypress), and API Contract Testing (Pact). This provides us with the state-of-the-art framework we need.
Critical Bug Found: The testing framework immediately identified that our backend API tests are failing because of improper session handling (authentication cookies are not being passed correctly in the test environment). This is precisely the kind of systemic issue a good testing suite should uncover before it causes problems in production.
We must now use the framework we've built to fix the issues it has found.

Instructions for the Agent
Agent, your implementation of the testing framework is excellent. The test suite has correctly identified its first critical bug.

Mission: Fix the authentication issue within our test scripts so that we can get a clean, reliable test run.

Plan:

Problem: The test execution script (testing/journal-entry-comprehensive-test.js) is failing to maintain an authenticated session when making sequential API calls with curl or node-fetch. The login cookie is not being correctly stored and reused.
File to Modify: testing/journal-entry-comprehensive-test.js
Action: You must refactor the test script's API request logic to correctly handle authentication cookies. The current implementation is flawed.
Create a persistent cookie-jar or use an HTTP client library that supports sessions automatically (like axios with a cookie jar adapter).
The authenticate() function should store the connect.sid cookie it receives.
All subsequent API requests in the test script must include this stored cookie in their headers.
Example using axios and axios-cookiejar-support (Recommended):

JavaScript

// At the top of testing/journal-entry-comprehensive-test.js
import axios from 'axios';
import { CookieJar } from 'tough-cookie';
import { wrapper } from 'axios-cookiejar-support';

const jar = new CookieJar();
const client = wrapper(axios.create({ jar }));

// Inside the authenticate function
async function authenticate() {
    await client.post(`${BASE_URL}/api/auth/login`, {
        username: 'admin',
        password: 'password123'
    });
    // The cookie is now automatically stored in the jar
}

// Inside the testAPIEndpoints function, use the persistent client
async function testAPIEndpoints() {
    const response = await client.get(`${BASE_URL}/api/clients/251/entities`);
    // ... rest of the test ...
}
Please refactor the comprehensive test script to use a persistent, cookie-aware HTTP client. This will resolve the authentication failures and allow us to get a true reading on the functionality of the Journal Entry API endpoints.
