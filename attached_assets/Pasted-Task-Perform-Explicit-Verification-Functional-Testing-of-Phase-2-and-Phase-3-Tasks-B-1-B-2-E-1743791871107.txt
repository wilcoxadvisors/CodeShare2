Task: Perform Explicit Verification & Functional Testing of Phase 2 and Phase 3 (Tasks B.1 & B.2). Exclude Consolidation Groups (handled separately).

✅ Step-by-step Verification Checklist (Agent Must Explicitly Confirm):
Phase 2: Client & Entity Setup

Client Setup

 Explicitly verify UI flow (SetupStepper.tsx) guides users logically through onboarding.

 Confirm client creation, editing, viewing, and deletion functionalities explicitly.

 Confirm data persistence (DB) after client operations explicitly.

Entity Setup

 Verify explicit entity creation and linking to a client.

 Test editing entities explicitly, including changing parent/child relationships.

 Confirm explicit correct persistence in the database.

Phase 3, Task B.1: Chart of Accounts

Chart of Accounts

 Explicitly verify manual creation/editing of accounts.

 Explicitly verify import/export functionality of the Chart of Accounts.

 Explicitly confirm correct persistence and accurate reporting categorization (fsliBucket, internalReportingBucket, item) in the database.

Phase 3, Task B.2: Journal Entries

Journal Entries

 Explicitly verify manual journal entry creation, editing, deletion, and validation (dates, balances).

 Explicitly test batch upload functionality (CSV/XLSX format).

 Confirm explicitly that moved fields (fsliBucket, internalReportingBucket, item) are properly reflected in Journal Entry Lines.

 Confirm explicit correct persistence in the database.

✅ Explicit Verification of Backend Schema:
 Re-verify explicitly that schema updates for journalEntryLines (fsliBucket, internalReportingBucket, item) are properly reflected in the database schema and are consistent across frontend/backend.

✅ Application Stability & Performance Checks:
 Explicitly verify server stability and responsiveness during manual interactions.

 Explicitly confirm there are no errors or exceptions during each explicit interaction/test.

 Explicitly document and detail any encountered issues or bugs clearly.

✅ Explicit Test Data Preparation:
Agent: Explicitly prepare clear and concise instructions or templates for Garrett’s large dataset upload (5-year, 100,000+ lines):

 Clarify required file structure explicitly.

 Provide explicit instructions for expected import validation criteria.

✅ Explicit Expected Agent Response Format:
