Agent Task: Implement Dashboard Guided Setup Flow (Phase 2 - Initial Steps)

Objective: Begin restructuring the Admin Dashboard (CodeShare/client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx) to incorporate a sequential setup flow and implement the first setup card component.

Instructions:

Refactor Dashboard Structure:

Modify CodeShare/client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx.
Introduce state management (e.g., using useState) to track the current activeStep of the setup process (starting at 0).
Add a visual stepper component (use a suitable UI library component or create a custom one) to display the initial prioritized steps:
Client Info
Entities
Summary & Finish Initial Setup (Later steps like Consolidation, CoA, Data Import will be added after this initial flow)
Implement conditional rendering within the dashboard to display specific "Setup Card" components based on the activeStep. Focus on rendering the first card when activeStep is 0.
Create ClientSetupCard.tsx (Step 1):

Create a new component file: CodeShare/client/src/components/setup/ClientSetupCard.tsx.
Implement a form within this card to collect initial client/organization details (e.g., Company Name, Admin User contact info). Reuse existing components like ClientOnboardingForm.tsx if suitable, adapting it into this card structure [cite: 2543-2547].
Add form validation using Zod (from CodeShare/client/src/lib/validation.ts).
Implement an onNext function prop. On successful form submission:
Save the client data via a backend API call.
Trigger the parent Dashboard.tsx component to advance the activeStep to 1.
Ensure the card integrates visually within the dashboard layout (using components from CodeShare/client/src/components/ui/ if appropriate) [cite: 2556].
Completion Criteria:

The Admin Dashboard displays a stepper indicating the initial setup stages (Client, Entities, Summary).
The ClientSetupCard component is created and rendered when the activeStep is 0.
The ClientSetupCard form can collect basic client info, validate it, save it via an API call, and trigger the transition to the next step.
