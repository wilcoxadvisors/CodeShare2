üëè Great progress!
You hit the functional goals for Bug #7:

multipart uploads now succeed

user-visible progress is in place in both create/edit and detail views

UI adapts to entry status (draft, pending, posted, voided)

rejected-file feedback is visible

Below are a few polish items and quality-gate checkpoints to close the loop before we mark the feature ‚Äúdone‚Äù and move on to Batch JE Upload.

1 ‚Äî Polish & UX tweaks (quick wins)

Area	Why it helps	Suggested tweak
Progress bar clarity	A thin bar can be missed on large monitors	Bump height to h-2 (8 px) and add a subtle shadow; keep colour in tonal range (e.g., bg-primary/70).
Concurrent uploads	Multiple large files may overlap percentages	Store progress in a keyed object ({ [fileId]: pct }) and render per-row bars so simultaneous uploads don‚Äôt overwrite a single state variable.
Cancel / retry	Users occasionally drop the wrong file	Add a small ‚úï icon on each in-flight row that calls axiosCancelTokenSource.cancel().
Download icon	Currently text only	Swap to ArrowDownToLine (lucide) next to filename for quick recognition.
Accessibility	Screen-reader users need status	Give the progress <div role="progressbar" aria-valuenow={pct} aria-valuemin={0} aria-valuemax={100}>.
Max size notice	Prevent 100 MB surprises	Hard-limit to, say, 10 MB per file via maxSize in react-dropzone and show a tooltip: ‚ÄúMax 10 MB; PDFs, images, Office docs, CSV, TXT.‚Äù
These are all <15 min touch-ups each; take whichever fit your timeline.

2 ‚Äî Quality gate checklist (must-pass)
Debug log present

ts
Copy
Edit
console.log("DEBUG Attachment:", { journalEntryId, fileCount });
Cypress

Extend journalEntry.spec.cy.ts

Upload two small fixtures.

Assert each row hits 100 %.

Assert file list persists after page reload.

Jest (backend)

test/journalEntryAttachment.test.ts

POST multipart => 200

GET /files/:id returns content-disposition: attachment; filename=...;.

Static checks

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run lint && npm run format
npx ts-prune && npx knip
./run-tests.sh      # should output all green
Screenshots / artefacts
Attach a screenshot of the new progress UI and paste the Jest + Cypress summaries in the PR comment.

3 ‚Äî Security sanity
Ensure server-side MIME/type whitelist mirrors the front-end accept list.

Strip path and double-extension tricks (evil.pdf.exe).

Scan file size server-side and reject > 10 MB with 413 Payload Too Large.

4 ‚Äî When all green ‚Üí close Bug #7
Post a short diff summary and mark the Jira ticket / GitHub issue resolved.

5 ‚Äî Next sprint prep
As soon as Bug #7 is closed, we‚Äôll move to Batch Journal Entry Upload (Task B.2.2). I‚Äôll draft the detailed endpoint spec and CSV/XLSX schema once you give the all-clear.

Let me know if any of the polish items need clarifying or if you hit snags on the tests‚Äîotherwise, go ahead and knock these out!
