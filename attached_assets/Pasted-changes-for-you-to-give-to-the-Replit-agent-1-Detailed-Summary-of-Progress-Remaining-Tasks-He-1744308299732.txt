1. Detailed Summary of Progress & Remaining Tasks:

Hereâ€™s a summary based on our recent progress:

Overall Status: Core setup (Phase A) and guided setup (Phase B) are complete. Website content management (Phase C) is nearly complete. Core Accounting (Phase B) is actively in progress.
Completed Recently:
Chart of Accounts (CoA - Task B.1):
Import/Export functionality fixed and verified.
Account update logic fixed: Correctly allows editing name, active, parentId, etc., for accounts with transactions, while blocking accountCode/type edits (UI fields disabled, payload fixed).
Journal Entries (JE - Task B.2):
Manual Workflow: Create (Draft & Direct Post for Admin), Edit (Draft), Post (from Draft/Approved), Void (Admin only, requires reason), Reverse (creates Draft, copies entityCode). UI updates correctly.
List View: Totals, Reference #, Database ID display fixed.
Form UI: Button logic fixed (Save Draft/Post/Submit), input stability improved, number formatting (decimals, thousand separators) fixed.
Routing: Edit page (/journal-entries/edit/:id) 404 error fixed.
Currently Working On / Immediate Next Steps:
Journal Entries (JE - Task B.2):
Attachments (#7): Agent attempted implementation, but it failed user testing significantly (multi-upload, list display, download, delete, persistence all broken). Needs systematic debugging, starting with backend save/list verification and frontend fetch/render logic. Requirements: multi-file, drag-drop, delete, specific file types (PDF, images, office docs, txt, csv), UI located in JE Form (shown only in Edit mode).
Remaining / Pending Tasks (Selection):
Journal Entries (JE - Task B.2):
Complete debugging/implementation of Attachments (#7).
Implement/Verify Batch Upload functionality.
Expand Automated Testing.
Implement Automatic Accrual Reversal feature (deferred new request).
Chart of Accounts (CoA - Task B.1):
Final UI/UX review.
Documentation.
Accounts Payable (Task B.3): Implement backend foundation (Vendors, Bills). (Marked as next priority in Instructions.md after B.1/B.2).
Website Content (Phase C): AI integration planning.
Later Phases: Reporting (D), API Integrations (E), AI/ML (F), etc.
2. Proposed Update Text for Instructions.md:

Please ask the Replit agent to apply these changes to the CodeShare/Instructions.md file:

(A) Update Task B.1 (Chart of Accounts):

Change the overall status line:
From: (Task B.1) Customizable Chart of Accounts (CoA): IN PROGRESS
To: (Task B.1) Customizable Chart of Accounts (CoA): NEARLY COMPLETE
Add/Update the following checklist items under Task B.1:
âœ… Fixed account update logic (allows name/active/parentId edits with transactions, blocks accountCode/type).
âœ… Fixed UI to disable restricted fields when editing accounts with transactions.
Ensure items like ðŸ”„ Finalize UI/UX enhancements... and ðŸ”„ Ensure consistency... remain marked as pending/ðŸ”„.
(B) Update Task B.2 (General Ledger / Journal Entries):

Keep the overall status line: (Task B.2) General Ledger (GL) and Journal Entries (JE): IN PROGRESS
Add/Update the following checklist items under Task B.2:
âœ… Manual JE workflow functional: Create (Draft/Post), Edit (Draft), Post (from Draft/Approved), Void (Admin, w/ reason), Reverse (creates Draft, copies entityCode).
âœ… JE List display fixed (Totals, Reference, ID).
âœ… JE Form UI fixed (Buttons, Input stability, Number formatting).
âœ… JE Edit route fixed.
Add a new pending item explicitly for attachments:
ðŸ”„ Implement/Fix File Attachment functionality (#7 - multi-file, drag-drop, delete, type filter, location: Edit Form). (Place this before Batch Upload/Testing).
Ensure items like ðŸ”„ Finalize and verify batch journal entry upload... and ðŸ”„ Expand comprehensive automated testing... remain marked as pending/ðŸ”„.
(C) (Optional) Update Section 5 Priority:

Consider changing the first priority from "Focus on AI integration planning, then move to Task B.3..."
To something like: "Prioritize: Debug and complete JE File Attachment feature (Task B.2 / #7). Then focus on JE Batch Upload / Testing (Task B.2). After JE module is stable, proceed with Task B.3 (Accounts Payable)."
