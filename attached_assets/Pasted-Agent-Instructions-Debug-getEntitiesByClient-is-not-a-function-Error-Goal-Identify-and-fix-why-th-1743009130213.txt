Agent Instructions: Debug getEntitiesByClient is not a function Error

Goal: Identify and fix why the getEntitiesByClient function is causing a "not a function" error when called from adminRoutes.ts, despite your previous implementation attempt.

Relevant Files:

server/storage.ts (Check DatabaseStorage class and IStorage interface)
server/adminRoutes.ts (Specifically the route handler calling getEntitiesByClient, around line 56)
Debugging Steps:

Verify Implementation in DatabaseStorage:
Action: Open server/storage.ts. Carefully check the DatabaseStorage class.
Verify: Does the async getEntitiesByClient(clientId: number): Promise<Entity[]> { ... } method definitely exist inside the DatabaseStorage class definition? Check for typos, incorrect placement (e.g., outside the class brackets), or syntax errors within the method.
Verify: Does the method signature exactly match the definition in the IStorage interface?
Verify storage Instance in adminRoutes.ts:
Action: Open server/adminRoutes.ts. Find where the storage object is initialized (it might be imported or instantiated near the top).
Verify: Is this storage object definitely an instance of the DatabaseStorage class (or whichever class implements getEntitiesByClient)? How is it created/imported?
Trace the Function Call:
Action: In server/adminRoutes.ts, go to the route handler indicated by the error (around line 56).
Add Logging (Temporarily):
Just before the line await storage.getEntitiesByClient(clientId) (or similar call), add:
TypeScript

console.log('Storage object type:', typeof storage, 'Has getEntitiesByClient:', typeof storage?.getEntitiesByClient);
console.log('Attempting to call getEntitiesByClient with clientId:', clientId);
Inside the getEntitiesByClient method definition within DatabaseStorage in server/storage.ts, add at the very beginning:
TypeScript

console.log(`Entered DatabaseStorage.getEntitiesByClient with clientId: ${clientId}`);
Retest and Analyze Logs:
Restart the application.
Simulate the action that triggers the error (logging in and viewing client details/entities).
Action: Examine the server logs carefully.
Do you see the "Storage object type:" log? What does it say? Does it confirm storage.getEntitiesByClient is a function just before the call?
Do you see the "Entered DatabaseStorage.getEntitiesByClient" log? If not, the call isn't reaching the implementation correctly.
Do you still see the "storage.getEntitiesByClient is not a function" error?
Report: Detail the output of the log statements and whether the error persists. Explain the findings based on the logs (e.g., "The storage object was of type X, and getEntitiesByClient was undefined," or "The function call never reached the DatabaseStorage implementation.").
Fix Based on Findings:
Action: Based on the debugging logs, correct the issue. This might involve:
Fixing the implementation in DatabaseStorage if it was incorrect.
Correcting how the storage object is instantiated or imported in adminRoutes.ts.
Fixing the function call itself in adminRoutes.ts.
DO NOT work on any other feature (like Edit Client) until this specific error is resolved and you can successfully fetch entities by client ID without a "not a function" error.
