Architect's Root Cause Analysis
Based on a thorough review of the logs, I have identified the root causes for both issues.

File Upload Failure on New Entries:

User Report: The upload area for a new entry incorrectly shows "Files can't be added once the entry is posted."
Root Cause: The AttachmentSection component, which controls the upload UI, is being told that it is not in "edit mode" when the form is for a new entry.
Evidence: The log ARCHITECT_DEBUG_ATTACHMENT_PERMISSIONS shows isInEditMode: false for the new entry form. The permission check canModifyAttachments requires isInEditMode to be true. Since it's false, the component incorrectly believes it's in a read-only state and displays the wrong message, disabling uploads. This is a logic flaw in JournalEntryForm.tsx.
Save/Post Failure (Accrual Date Error):

User Report: Cannot save a draft or post a new entry because the system incorrectly demands an accrual date, even when the accrual feature is not enabled.
Root Cause: The backend API is incorrectly applying validation rules. The Zod validation schema (updateJournalEntrySchema) being used for the PUT and POST requests requires the reversalDate field, even when isAccrual is false.
Evidence: The console log clearly shows the API request failing with a 400 Bad Request error:
DEBUG: Journal entry update error: Error: API request failed with status 400 Bad Request
Details: { "errors": { "reversalDate": "Reversal date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format" } }
This proves the backend is validating the reversalDate field unconditionally, which is incorrect.
Definitive Fix Plan
Both of these critical bugs will be fixed by making targeted changes to the frontend form logic and the backend validation schema.

Mission: Repair the new journal entry workflow by correcting the UI state logic for attachment permissions and the backend validation logic for accrual-related fields.

Instructions for the Agent:

Part 1: Fix Attachment Permissions for New Entries

File to Modify: client/src/features/journal-entries/components/JournalEntryForm.tsx.
Action: Locate the <AttachmentSection ... /> component in the JSX. You must correct the value being passed to the isInEditMode prop. A new entry form should always be considered editable.
Change this: isInEditMode={!!existingEntry}
To this: isInEditMode={!existingEntry || existingEntry.status === 'draft'}
This correctly sets the mode to true for new entries (!existingEntry) and for drafts, while correctly setting it to false for posted entries.
Part 2: Fix Conditional Form Validation

File to Modify: shared/validation.ts.
Locate updateJournalEntrySchema: Find the Zod schema used for validating journal entry updates.
Action: The schema must be modified so that reversalDate is only required if isAccrual is true. You will use Zod's refine method for this conditional validation.
Modify the schema definition:
TypeScript

// In shared/validation.ts

export const updateJournalEntrySchema = z.object({
  // ... other fields
  isAccrual: z.boolean().optional(),
  reversalDate: z.string().optional(),
  // ... other fields
}).refine(data => {
    // If isAccrual is true, reversalDate must be a valid date string.
    if (data.isAccrual) {
      return data.reversalDate && /^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/.test(data.reversalDate);
    }
    // Otherwise, we don't need to validate reversalDate.
    return true;
  }, {
    message: "Reversal date is required for accrual entries and must be in YYYY-MM-DD format.",
    path: ["reversalDate"], // Specify the path of the error.
});
These two fixes will correctly enable the attachment section for new entries and ensure the form validates properly, allowing new drafts to be saved and posted without error.
