🚩 Immediate Next Steps (Actionable Instructions for Agent):
Here's a concise and explicit task set to address the identified issues clearly:

✅ Task 1: Resolve Residual Logic in storage.ts
Clearly identify all direct database operations still located within storage.ts:

bash
Copy
Edit
grep -E "await db|await.*find|await.*create|await.*update|await.*delete" server/storage/storage.ts
Explicitly move these identified operations into their respective specialized storage modules (clientStorage.ts, entityStorage.ts, accountStorage.ts, etc.).

Ensure clean delegation patterns and explicitly verify no residual logic remains in storage.ts afterward.

✅ Task 2: Define Comprehensive Test Script
Explicitly add a comprehensive testing script to your package.json to ensure automated tests can be executed clearly:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest" // assuming jest as the test framework; adjust if mocha/chai or others are used
  }
}
If no testing framework is set up yet, explicitly choose Jest or Mocha/Chai as recommended in your original strategic docs.

Explicitly verify the tests pass successfully:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install --save-dev jest
npm run test
Clearly document and report any failing tests or missing test cases.

📌 Agent Expected Response Format:
After completing these two clear tasks, your agent should explicitly confirm completion and report back clearly with the following format:

## ✅ Issue Resolution Report

### Residual Logic in `storage.ts`:
- ✅ Identified and explicitly moved all residual database operations to their specialized storage modules.
- ✅ Verified no direct database logic remains in `storage.ts`.

### Comprehensive Test Script Setup:
- ✅ Added test script explicitly to `package.json`.
- ✅ Verified successful execution of automated tests (all passing).

OR

- ⚠️ Tests identified issues (clearly document each failing test or missing case explicitly).

---

### Final Status:
✅ All identified issues explicitly resolved and verified.
OR
⚠️ Remaining unresolved issues (explicitly detail each clearly).
📝 Instructions.md Update:
After your agent resolves these issues, explicitly instruct the agent to update Instructions.md clearly, reflecting:

Explicitly completed storage module refactoring (no residual logic).

Explicitly defined and verified comprehensive testing setup.

🎯 Next Action (Agent):
Immediately begin resolving these two clearly identified critical issues. Document and explicitly report back clearly as instructed above.
