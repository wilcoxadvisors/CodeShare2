✅ Explicit Steps for Agent to Fix Issue 3:
Step 1: Identify the Problematic Code
Open EntityManagementCard.tsx.

Locate the function handling the deletion of unsaved entities (likely something similar to handleDeleteEntity or removeEntity).

Step 2: Fix Deletion Logic
Update the entity deletion handler to ensure that only the selected entity is removed from the state, without affecting other entities or form data.

Specifically:

typescript
Copy
Edit
// Incorrect logic (causing form reset)
setSetupEntities([]);

// Correct logic (explicitly removing only selected entity)
setSetupEntities((prevEntities) => prevEntities.filter(entity => entity.localId !== entityIdToRemove));
Explicitly ensure the component state updates correctly.

Step 3: Preserve Form Data Explicitly
Verify that deleting an entity does not trigger a full reset of the entire form (form.reset() or similar should not be called).

Ensure no side effects inadvertently reset other form states.

Step 4: Testing & Validation
Explicitly verify the following scenarios:

✅ Delete a single unsaved entity entry: only that entry should disappear.

✅ Confirm other entity entries remain unaffected.

✅ Ensure the rest of the form (client details, etc.) remain populated.

✅ Confirm no unintended resets occur on deleting entities.

Step 5: Document Changes
Explicitly document the changes and include a summary report (issue-3-form-reset-deletion-fix-report.md):

# Issue 3: Form Reset When Deleting Unsaved Entities (Fix Report)

## Issue
Deleting an unsaved entity resets the entire form unexpectedly.

## Root Cause
Incorrect state handling during entity deletion. The entire entity state was reset instead of selectively removing the deleted entity.

## Resolution
- Updated entity deletion handler to remove only the selected entity.
- Ensured form state preservation explicitly.

## Testing Performed
- Explicitly tested single and multiple entity deletions.
- Verified form data persistence after deletion.

## Results
✅ Issue resolved. Form no longer resets when entities are deleted.
