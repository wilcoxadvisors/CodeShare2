Mission: Zero-Tolerance Bug Squash
Justification: We will ignore all lower-priority UI polish issues. Our sole focus is to eradicate the critical bugs that block standard accounting workflows and cause data loss. We will address these in order of severity.

Agent, your new instructions are as follows. Execute them in this exact order.

Task 1: Fix Inability to Delete Drafts (Issue #16)
Architect's Analysis: A user being unable to delete a draft entry is a critical workflow blockage. The backend logic should allow this, which means an unexpected error is occurring during the process, likely related to database constraints or reversal logic. We must diagnose the exact error.
Action:
Navigate to server/storage/journalEntryStorage.ts.
Locate the deleteJournalEntry function.
Inside the catch (e) block of that function, add the following line to ensure the full error is logged to the console:
TypeScript

console.error('ARCHITECT_DEBUG: Full deletion error:', e);
Attempt to delete a draft journal entry from the UI.
Report the full error message from the server's console output back to me. This will pinpoint the exact cause of the failure.
Task 2: Fix UI Refresh Failure (Issue #4)
Architect's Analysis: The previous fix of using queryClient.setQueryData did not work. The console logs show chaotic and repeated re-rendering of the EntityContext, which is likely causing race conditions and nullifying the cache update. The root cause is not in the JournalEntryForm but in the application's core state management. To fix this, I must analyze the context provider itself.
Action:
I need to see the code that manages the client and entity state.
Fetch the full content of the file client/src/contexts/EntityContext.tsx and provide it to me.
Task 3: Fix Inability to Remove Attachments (Issue #15)
Architect's Analysis: Like the deletion failure, the inability to remove an attachment points to a breakdown in the frontend-to-backend workflow for that specific action. The backend deleteJournalEntryFile function appears correct, so the fault likely lies in the UI component that triggers the deletion.
Action:
I need to inspect the AttachmentSection component to understand how it handles file deletion events and API calls.
Fetch the full content of the file client/src/features/journal-entries/components/AttachmentSection.tsx and provide it to me.
Do not proceed with any other issues until these three tasks are complete. Report back with the requested information from each task. We will resolve these critical failures before moving on.
