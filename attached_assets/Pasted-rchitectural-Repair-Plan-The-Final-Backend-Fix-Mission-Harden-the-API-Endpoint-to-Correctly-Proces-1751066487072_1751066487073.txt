rchitectural Repair Plan: The Final Backend Fix
Mission: Harden the API Endpoint to Correctly Process Multipart Form Data

Objective: To fix the 400 Bad Request error by ensuring the backend route correctly parses all text fields from the FormData payload before attempting to validate them.

Architect's Instruction for Agent:

You will now repair the batch-analyze route by correcting how it handles multipart/form-data. Do not modify any frontend files.

File to Edit: server/journalEntryRoutes.ts

Surgical Instructions:

Ensure Correct Middleware Order: The multerMiddleware must be executed before any other logic in the route handler. This is the most critical step.

Remove Ineffective Code: Delete the previous try/catch block and the Zod validation you added. It is not working because req.body is not being populated correctly. We will rebuild it with the correct understanding.

Implement New, Corrected Validation Logic:

Inside the POST /api/.../batch-analyze route handler, after the multerMiddleware has run, req.body should now be correctly populated with the text fields from the form.

First, add this diagnostic log:

JavaScript

console.log('ARCHITECT_DEBUG: Request body AFTER multer:', req.body);
Next, re-implement the Zod validation schema exactly as before.

Finally, wrap the Zod parsing in a try/catch block as I previously instructed. This time, it will work because req.body will contain the data to be validated.

Example of the Corrected Route Handler Structure:

JavaScript

app.post('/api/clients/:clientId/journal-entries/batch-analyze', 
  authenticateUser, 
  multerMiddleware, // Multer runs first!
  asyncHandler(async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    
    console.log('ARCHITECT_DEBUG: Request body AFTER multer:', req.body); // New Diagnostic Log

    // Zod schema definition here...
    const batchAnalyzeSchema = z.object({ ... });

    try {
      // Zod parsing and the rest of the logic here...
      const validatedData = batchAnalyzeSchema.parse(req.body);
      // ...
    } catch (error) {
      // Error handling here...
    }
}));
Verification:

Once this is complete, I need you to test one more time. The "Analyze File" button should finally work. The ARCHITECT_DEBUG log in the server console should now print the full object containing the description, importMode, and other fields you entered in the form.
