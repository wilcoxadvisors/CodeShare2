Agent Instructions: Capture & Analyze Backend Logs for 500 Error

CRITICAL ISSUE: Frontend logs provided by the user confirm a 500 Internal Server Error occurs when updating an entity via the UI in Step 2 (potentially after navigating back from Step 3). You must capture the backend logs during this failure.

Goal: Use the detailed backend logging already in place to diagnose the cause of the 500 error in the PUT /api/admin/entities/:entityId request handler or the storage.updateEntity method when triggered by the specific user scenario.

Relevant Files:

server/adminRoutes.ts (Contains the PUT /api/admin/entities/:entityId route handler with logging)
server/storage.ts (Contains the updateEntity database logic with logging)
Debugging Steps:

Authenticate & Reproduce Error:
Action: Authenticate programmatically (admin / password123).
Action: Simulate the UI flow again, exactly as the user described or tested: Dashboard -> Add Client -> Step 1 -> Step 2 -> Add Entity(ies) -> (Optional: Step 3 -> Back to Step 2) -> Edit Entity -> Click "Save Changes".
Action: Monitor the Backend Console closely during the "Save Changes" action that triggers the PUT request and results in the 500 error.
Capture & Analyze Backend Logs:
Action: Copy ALL logs from the Backend Console that appear during the failing PUT request.
Action: Look specifically for the "DEBUG:" logs within the route handler and storage.updateEntity.
Action: Pinpoint where the execution stops or the specific error message (from Node.js, Drizzle, DB driver, etc.) that is logged just before the 500 response is sent.
Report Findings:
Action: Provide the specific backend error message.
Action: Include the sequence of relevant "DEBUG:" logs from the backend console leading up to the error.
Implement Backend Fix:
Action: Based on the specific backend error identified, implement the fix in server/adminRoutes.ts or server/storage.ts.
Verify Fix:
Action: Restart the application.
Action: Repeat the exact test simulation that previously caused the error.
Action: Confirm the PUT request now succeeds (Status 200 OK) without backend errors. Check backend logs. Report success.
