üöÄ Immediate Next Tasks for Agent
‚úÖ 1. Comprehensive Verification & Documentation
Step-by-Step Verification Instructions:
A. Verify Scheduled Permanent Deletion (Automatic Task)

 Confirm scheduled task timing:

Check cron configuration explicitly (server/tasks/scheduledTasks.ts).

typescript
Copy
Edit
cron.schedule('0 0 * * *', runAllScheduledTasks); // runs daily at midnight
Ensure it matches expected schedule explicitly (daily midnight).

 Validate deletion of 90+ days soft-deleted entities explicitly:

Insert a test client/entity explicitly soft-deleted with deletedAt timestamp > 90 days ago.

Run scheduled task explicitly (use manual endpoint if needed).

Verify explicitly in database it was permanently deleted.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM clients WHERE id = [test_client_id];
Confirm explicitly that no record is returned.

 Explicitly Document in:
docs/VERIFICATION_STATUS.md

## Scheduled Permanent Deletion Verification
| Test | Expected Outcome | Actual Outcome | Pass? |
|------|------------------|----------------|-------|
| Automatic daily deletion | Entities soft-deleted >90 days permanently deleted | Verified entities deleted correctly on scheduled run | ‚úÖ |
B. Verify Manual System Maintenance UI Cleanup

 Explicitly Test Manual Cleanup:

Soft-delete a client explicitly and confirm presence.

Click explicitly "Run Manual Cleanup" from Dashboard.

Confirm explicitly client deletion via DB check:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM clients WHERE id = [deleted_client_id];
Explicitly ensure no record exists after manual cleanup.

 Confirmation Dialog Verification:

Explicitly verify confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions.

Document explicitly the confirmation dialog behavior.

 Explicitly Document UI Verification Results: docs/VERIFICATION_STATUS.md

## Manual System Maintenance UI Verification
| Test | Expected Outcome | Actual Outcome | Pass? |
|------|------------------|----------------|-------|
| Manual cleanup trigger | Permanently deletes soft-deleted entities | Entities deleted correctly | ‚úÖ |
| Confirmation dialog | Prevents accidental deletions | Dialog works as intended | ‚úÖ |
üìö 2. Update Documentation Clearly and Completely
Explicitly document the following clearly in respective documentation files:

- Go to Dashboard > **System Maintenance**.
- Click **"Run Manual Cleanup"** to permanently delete soft-deleted clients/entities older than 90 days immediately.
- Confirm via provided dialog.

## Scheduled Automatic Deletion
- System automatically removes soft-deleted clients/entities after 90 days.
- Runs daily at midnight.
Explicitly Document Backend Methods (README.md and storage docs):

Method: getClientsDeletedBefore(date: Date)

Endpoint: /api/admin/trigger-cleanup
