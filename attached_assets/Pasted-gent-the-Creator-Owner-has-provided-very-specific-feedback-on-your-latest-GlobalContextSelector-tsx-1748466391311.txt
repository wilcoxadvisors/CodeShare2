gent, the Creator/Owner has provided very specific feedback on your latest GlobalContextSelector.tsx refinements. While manual client/entity switching is now functional (which is good!), the current UX for Browse and initial display within the selector is still not meeting their needs. The "auto-expand selected client" or "auto-expand all" strategies are not correct.

Key Feedback from Creator/Owner:

"Entities still dont load under client right away." (Meaning: they are not immediately visible under each client in an expandable way when the selector is opened).
"I should be able to expand the client and see the entities to chose when needed." (User wants manual control over expanding a client to see its entities).
"I want to be able to see and expand clients without out selecting entities." (Browse entities under a client should not immediately change the application's active context until an entity or client is explicitly clicked for selection).
"chart of accounts page still show entities when selecting a client." (The showEntities={false} logic needs to be correctly applied and effective).
CRITICAL REGRESSION: "This reloads the page and its kinda harsh reload." (This was observed by the Creator/Owner when testing client selection â€“ any page reload during client/entity selection is a P0 bug).
Task 1: (IMMEDIATE P0 UX FIX) Implement True User-Controlled Hierarchical Client/Entity Selector with NO Page Reloads

Action - Overhaul client/src/components/dashboard/GlobalContextSelector.tsx Interaction Model:

Remove All Automatic Client Expansion on Dropdown Open:
Disable or remove any useEffect or useMemo logic that causes any client (even the selected one) or all clients to auto-expand when the dropdown opens or when clients/entities load.
Initial State: When the dropdown opens, all clients should be listed collapsed by default.
Exception for Persistence: If a selectedClientId is restored from localStorage, the UI should indicate this client is active (e.g., highlight its name, show a checkmark next to it if showEntities={false}), but it should not necessarily be auto-expanded in the list unless that's a separate explicit UX decision we make later. For now, prioritize fixing the "stuck" and "reload" issues.
Implement User-Driven Expand/Collapse:
Each client item in the dropdown list must have a distinct expand/collapse icon (e.g., ChevronRight for collapsed, ChevronDown for expanded).
The toggleClientExpansion(clientId, event) function:
Must call event.stopPropagation() to prevent the client itself from being selected if the user only clicked the chevron.
Must only flip the boolean state for expandedClients[clientId]. It should not affect other clients' expansion states or change the main application context (selectedClientId, currentEntity).
Conditional Rendering of Entities:
Entities for a client are rendered as nested sub-items only if showEntities is true AND expandedClients[client.id] is true.
Ensure only active, non-deleted entities are shown.
Selection Logic (Clicking on Names):
Clicking a Client Name:
Calls selectClient(clientId).
This function sets selectedClientId(newClientId) and setCurrentEntity(null) (EntityContext will then auto-select the first active entity for this new client if showEntities is true).
It should also update expandedClients to ensure this newClientId is now expanded: setExpandedClients(prev => ({ ...prev, [newClientId]: true }));
If showEntities={false} (for CoA view): It must call setOpen(false) to close the dropdown. Verify this thoroughly, as the Creator/Owner reported entities still showing for CoA.
NO PAGE RELOAD: This action must not cause a page reload. This indicates a fundamental issue, possibly with how navigation or state updates are being handled, or an uncaught error. Use browser dev tools to see if there's a full navigation event or a JavaScript error causing a crash/reload.
Clicking an Entity Name (under an already expanded client):
Calls selectEntity(entity).
This function sets currentEntity and selectedClientId(entity.clientId).
It should then call setOpen(false) to close the dropdown.
NO PAGE RELOAD.
Persistence: Ensure localStorage persistence for selectedClientId and currentEntity.id works correctly with this new interaction model.
Testing & Verification:

P0 Test: Confirm that clicking a client name or an entity name NEVER causes a page reload.
Scenario 1 (Desired UX): Login. Open selector. All clients are listed and collapsed. Click expand icon for Client A -> Client A's active entities appear nested below it; context does not change. Click expand icon for Client B -> Client B's active entities appear (Client A can remain expanded). Click Entity X under Client B -> Client B and Entity X become active context, dropdown closes.
Scenario 2 (CoA showEntities={false}): Open selector. Click Client A name -> Client A becomes active context, dropdown closes, no entities were shown.
Scenario 3 (Persistence): Restore context from localStorage. Open selector. The active client is shown (perhaps highlighted), but not necessarily auto-expanded unless that's a specific refined UX. User can expand it or other clients.
Provide ARCHITECT_DEBUG_ logs and a GIF/video of the selector interaction for these scenarios. The key is "no page reloads" and user-controlled expansion.

Once the Creator/Owner confirms this selector UX is perfect, we will address the other critical functional bugs from their list. This selector is used everywhere, so its stability and usability are paramount.
