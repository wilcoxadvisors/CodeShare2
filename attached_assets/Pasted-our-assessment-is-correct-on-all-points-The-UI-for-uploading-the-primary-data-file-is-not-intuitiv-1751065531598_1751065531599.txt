our assessment is correct on all points:

The UI for uploading the primary data file is not intuitive.

There is no way to remove an incorrect data file once selected.

The attachment functionality is broken.

The 400 Bad Request error persists, indicating a fundamental mismatch between the frontend and backend.

We will abandon the previous approach and execute a new, definitive repair plan that addresses these failures at their core. We will start by completely rebuilding the most critical part of the UI: the data file upload.

Architectural Repair Plan: The Final, Definitive Fix
Mission 1: Re-architect the Data File Upload Experience

Objective: To replace the confusing file input with a clear, intuitive, single-file upload component that allows for file selection and removal, directly addressing your feedback.

Architect's Instruction for Agent:

You are to surgically remove the existing data file input and replace it with a new, purpose-built component for handling the primary Excel/CSV data file.

File to Edit: client/src/features/journal-entries/components/UploadConfigurationForm.tsx

Surgical Instructions:

Remove Old UI: Delete the existing <Input type="file"> and any associated Label or Button that is currently used for uploading the main data file.

Create a New State for the Data File: At the top of the component, create a new state variable specifically for the data file.

JavaScript

const [dataFile, setDataFile] = useState<File | null>(null);
Implement a New Drag-and-Drop UI:

Create a new, visually distinct section labeled "Step 1: Upload Your Data File (.xlsx or .csv)".

Implement a drag-and-drop zone. When no file is selected, it should display a message like "Drag & drop your file here, or click to select a file."

When a file is selected (either by dropping or clicking), the UI must change to show:

The selected file's name (e.g., q3_marketing_spend.xlsx).

A "Remove File" button that, when clicked, clears the dataFile state and resets the UI to its initial state.

This entire component provides a much better user experience, as you suggested.

Update the "Analyze" Button Logic:

The main "Analyze File" button for the form must now be disabled if dataFile is null.

When the "Analyze File" button is clicked, the onSubmit function must now retrieve the file from the dataFile state variable to be included in the FormData payload.

This mission will fix the most significant UI and usability problems. Once it is complete, we will proceed to fix the data contract and the attachment flow. Execute Mission 1 now.
