🎯 Agent Instructions for Fixing UI Issues
Target File(s):

client/src/features/journal-entries/pages/JournalEntryDetail.tsx

client/src/features/journal-entries/components/JournalEntryForm.tsx

🚨 1. Voided Entry Detail Issues:
a. Hide "Edit" Button if Entry is Voided

Find the current conditional rendering logic of the "Edit" button in JournalEntryDetail.tsx.
Update the logic explicitly to hide if the entry status is "voided" or "posted":

tsx
Copy
Edit
{journalEntry.status !== 'voided' && journalEntry.status !== 'posted' && (
  <Button onClick={handleEditClick}>
    Edit
  </Button>
)}
b. Hide Attachment UI ("Supporting Documents") if Entry is Voided

In JournalEntryDetail.tsx, remove or conditionally render the attachment upload UI explicitly. The attachment upload UI should only appear on the edit/create form—not on the detail view.

Ensure explicitly no attachment UI in the detail view at all:

Completely remove the AttachmentSection from the Detail View if present. It should only appear explicitly in the edit/create form.

🚨 2. Posted Entry Detail Issues:
a. Hide Attachment UI on Posted Entries

In JournalEntryDetail.tsx, confirm explicitly no attachment UI rendering.
Attachment UI should never explicitly appear on the detail view for any entry status, especially not on "posted" or "voided" entries.

Remove any instances similar to:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<AttachmentSection journalEntryId={journalEntry.id} />
from JournalEntryDetail.tsx. Ensure attachments can only explicitly be managed from within the Edit Form.

🚨 3. Draft Entry Detail Issues:
a. Restore "Post Entry" Button for Admins on Draft Entries

In JournalEntryDetail.tsx, explicitly ensure the "Post Entry" button is visible for admins when viewing draft entries.

Check your user permissions logic explicitly (isAdmin) and entry status, and add:

tsx
Copy
Edit
{isAdmin && journalEntry.status === 'draft' && (
  <Button onClick={handlePostEntry}>
    Post Entry
  </Button>
)}
🚨 Explicit Checklist for Agent to Verify:
✅ Voided Entries:

 "Edit" button explicitly hidden.

 Attachment UI explicitly hidden on detail view.

✅ Posted Entries:

 Attachment UI explicitly hidden on detail view.

✅ Draft Entries (Detail View):

 "Post Entry" button explicitly visible (for admin users).

 Attachment UI explicitly hidden (should be in edit form only).

📝 Additional Clarification:

The AttachmentSection component (AttachmentSection) should only explicitly appear inside:

JournalEntryForm.tsx (create and edit modes)

Never explicitly render attachment UI in:

JournalEntryDetail.tsx
