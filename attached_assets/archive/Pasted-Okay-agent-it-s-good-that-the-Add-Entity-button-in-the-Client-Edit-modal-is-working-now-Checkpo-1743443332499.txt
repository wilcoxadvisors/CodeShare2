Okay, agent, it's good that the "Add Entity" button in the Client Edit modal is working now (Checkpoint 6cdd86dd). However, we need to address the critical issues the user reported earlier regarding the Chart of Accounts page and the React context error. Please pause any further feature implementation.

Task: Fix Core App Errors (Context & Chart of Accounts Page)

Goal: Resolve the React runtime error in AuthContext and fix the issues preventing the Chart of Accounts page from displaying data and creating new accounts.

1. Fix AuthContext.tsx Runtime Error:
* Issue: User reported Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState') error originating in client/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx.
* Action: Open client/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx.
* Action: Analyze the cause. This error usually means React hooks (useState) are called incorrectly (e.g., outside a component/hook, before React is imported, conditional hook calls). It's unlikely related to React simply not being "available".
* Action: Verify:
* React (useState, ReactNode, etc.) is correctly imported: import React, { useState, ... } from 'react';
* AuthProvider is a standard functional component (export function AuthProvider(...) { ... }).
* Hooks (useState) are called at the top level of the AuthProvider function, not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
* The AuthProvider is correctly exported and used to wrap the application tree (likely in App.tsx or main.tsx).
* Action: Implement the correct fix for the identified issue (e.g., fix imports, component structure, or provider setup). Do not simply wrap hooks in conditional checks.
* Report: Describe the root cause found and the fix applied to AuthContext.tsx. Confirm the runtime error no longer occurs after restarting the application.

2. Verify CoA Page Client Selection & Population:
* Issue: User reported "nothing happens when I select the client" and seeing "no client selected" on the CoA page, despite your previous fix attempt (Checkpoint d4383ecb).
* Action: After fixing the AuthContext error and restarting the app, navigate to the Chart of Accounts page (/chart-of-accounts).
* Action: Use the GlobalContextSelector in the header to select a client known to have accounts (e.g., "OK" - Client ID 2).
* Observe & Report:
* Does the page UI now correctly reflect the selected client (e.g., display the client name)?
* Does the main account table/tree populate with the accounts for the selected client?
* Does the "No client selected" message disappear? Report the outcome.

3. Debug "Create Account" 404 Error:
* Issue: User reported getting a 404 error when clicking the "Add Account" button on the CoA page.
* Action: (Perform this only if Step 2 confirms the page now populates correctly for a selected client) Investigate the 404 error:
* Frontend Check: Review client/src/pages/ChartOfAccounts.tsx. Confirm the useAddAccount mutation is correctly configured to send a POST request to the expected API endpoint (/api/clients/:clientId/accounts). Use browser dev tools (Network tab) or add logging if needed to verify the exact URL being called when the "Add Account" form is submitted.
* Backend Check: Review server/accountRoutes.ts. Verify that the route router.post('/api/clients/:clientId/accounts', ...) exists, is correctly defined, uses the right handler function (likely calling storage.createAccount), and doesn't have issues preventing it from being matched. Check server/routes.ts to ensure the accountRouter is correctly registered.
* Action: Implement the necessary fix (e.g., correct the API endpoint URL in the frontend mutation, fix the backend route definition/registration).
* Report: Describe the cause of the 404 error and the fix applied.
