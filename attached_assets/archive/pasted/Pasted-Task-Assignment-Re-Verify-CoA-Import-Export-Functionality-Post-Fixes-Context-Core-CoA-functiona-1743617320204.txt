Task Assignment: Re-Verify CoA Import/Export Functionality (Post-Fixes)

Context:
Core CoA functionality (Task B.1) is complete. Fixes have been implemented for the import logic (handling updates correctly based on accountCode/ID instead of creating duplicates) and export logic (correct headers). We now need to re-verify the end-to-end Import/Export functionality.

Goal:
Verify that the Chart of Accounts Import (CSV/Excel) correctly processes files (adds, updates existing accounts properly, inactivates) using accountCode and that Export generates files containing the correct AccountCode header and data (without the removed reporting fields).

Instructions:

Part 1: Use Updated Test Files

Action: Confirm Test Files:
Use the updated test files created previously (which exclude the removed reporting fields):
test/data/coa-import/updated-tests/test-accounts-import-updated.csv
test/data/coa-import/updated-tests/test-accounts-import-updated.xlsx
Confirm: Ensure these files contain rows designed to test adding accounts, updating existing accounts (with changed names/descriptions/etc. but matching accountCode or ID), and omitting accounts (for inactivation).
Part 2: Verify CoA Import via API/Script (Focus on Updates)

Action: Ensure Application is Running & Authenticated:

Verify the application is running (npm run dev).
Ensure valid authentication cookies are available (regenerate using scripts/login.js if needed).
Action: Test CSV Import via API:

Create a new test client via API (e.g., "Import RE-Verify CSV") for a clean state. Record its ID.
Seed this client with a minimal, known set of accounts before the import, ensuring some accountCodes will match the update rows in your test file. (You might need a small script or manual seeding via API/DB for this initial state).
Execute an API call (curl or test script) to import the updated test CSV file (test-accounts-import-updated.csv) for the new test client ID.
Observe & Report: Did the import API call complete successfully? Record the response message (counts of added/updated/inactive).
Verify Data (Crucial): Make API calls (GET /api/clients/:clientId/accounts) to fetch the accounts.
Verify Updates: Confirm accounts intended for update were actually updated (check changed fields) and not duplicated.
Verify adds and inactivations occurred correctly.
Action: Test Excel Import via API:

Create another new test client (e.g., "Import RE-Verify Excel"). Record its ID.
Seed this client similarly to Step 3.
Repeat Step 3 using the updated test Excel file (test-accounts-import-updated.xlsx). Verify updates, adds, and inactivations.
Part 3: Re-Verify CoA Export via API

Action: Test CSV Export via API:

Use a client with a known CoA state (e.g., one of the clients just used for import testing after the import finished).
Execute an API call (curl or script) to export the CoA to CSV (GET /api/clients/:clientId/accounts/export?format=csv). Save the output.
Analyze Exported File: Confirm AccountCode header, correct data, and absence of removed reporting fields.
Action: Test Excel Export via API:

Repeat Step 5 using the Excel export format (?format=excel).
Verification:

Confirm CSV and Excel imports successfully update existing accounts (based on accountCode or ID) without creating duplicates, correctly handle adds, and correctly mark omitted accounts as inactive.
Confirm CSV and Excel exports generate files with the correct AccountCode header and data, and do not include the removed reporting fields.
Reporting:

Report PASS/FAIL for CSV Import verification (Step 3), explicitly confirming updates worked correctly. Detail API responses and data verification results.
Report PASS/FAIL for Excel Import verification (Step 4), explicitly confirming updates worked correctly. Detail API responses and data verification results.
Report PASS/FAIL for CSV Export verification (Step 5). Describe the exported file's structure.
Report PASS/FAIL for Excel Export verification (Step 6). Describe the exported file's structure.
If all checks pass, confirm that CoA Import/Export functionality, including the update logic fix, is working correctly.
