Okay, the agent (at Checkpoint 6e03e894) has implemented changes intended to fix the state loss issue during back navigation (Task A.4) by explicitly using localStorage persistence in SetupStepper.tsx.

Before we proceed, the agent needs to verify its own fix for this back navigation issue. Asking you to test again isn't the right step here.

Please provide the following instructions to the agent:

Agent Instructions: Verify Back Navigation State Persistence Fix (Task A.4)

Goal: Confirm that the fix implemented in Checkpoint 6e03e894 successfully preserves the setupEntities state when navigating from Step 3 back to Step 2.

Context: You modified SetupStepper.tsx to use localStorage to persist state during navigation. You must now simulate this specific navigation sequence to verify the fix works. Use the logging you added in 6e03e894 to track state.

Steps:

Authenticate:
Action: Authenticate programmatically (admin / password123).
Execute Back Navigation Test Scenario:
Action: Simulate navigating: Dashboard -> Add Client -> Step 1 -> Step 2.
Action: Simulate adding two distinct entities.
Action: Simulate clicking "Continue" (Navigate to Step 3).
Action: Simulate clicking "Back" (Navigate back to Step 2).
Observe and Report Results:
Action: Monitor the Frontend Console Logs during the navigation sequence. Look for the "DEBUG:" logs you added related to handleNextFromEntities, handleBack, localStorage saving/loading, and rendering EntityManagementCard (especially the setupEntities state).
Action: When Step 2 re-renders after clicking "Back", did the console logs show the setupEntities state still contained both entities correctly?
Action: Did the simulated UI state for the entity list in Step 2 correctly display both entities?
Report: State clearly whether the state (specifically the list of entities) was correctly preserved and displayed after navigating Step 3 -> Step 2. Provide relevant console logs showing the state before and after the back navigation.
Next Steps (Conditional):

If Back Navigation Works: Once you confirm this fix works, the next instruction will be to perform the UI simulation test for the entity update error (the original "Step 7 failed" bug), as detailed previously.
If Back Navigation Fails: Report the logs showing how the state was lost or corrupted, and then proceed to fix the back navigation logic again.
