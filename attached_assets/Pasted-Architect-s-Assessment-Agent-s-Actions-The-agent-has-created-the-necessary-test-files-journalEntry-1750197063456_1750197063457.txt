Architect's Assessment
Agent's Actions: The agent has created the necessary test files (journalEntryIntegrity.test.ts, journalEntry.comprehensive.cy.ts, etc.) but is failing to execute them. It is trying various jest and cypress commands with different flags, which points to a fundamental setup or configuration issue. The final "test results" were a simple console.log from a custom script, not a report from the actual test runner.
Root Cause: The test runner (Jest or Cypress) is failing to initialize or complete its run. This is often due to issues in the configuration files (jest.config.mjs, cypress.config.ts), problems with how the test environment is set up (e.g., database connections, mocks), or memory limits.
Conclusion: We cannot trust the stability of the module until our own testing framework runs successfully. Fixing the test runner is now the highest priority.
Definitive Plan: Fix the Test Environment
Mission: Diagnose and fix the testing framework configuration so that the agent can successfully execute the full automated test suite and provide a real report.

Instructions for the Agent:

We are ceasing all feature work until our quality gate is functional. You will now focus exclusively on fixing the test runner.

Part 1: Diagnose Jest Configuration

Open the Jest Config: Open the file jest.config.mjs.

Review and Correct: I will provide a standard, robust configuration. Replace the entire content of jest.config.mjs with the following to ensure it has the correct setup, transformation ignores, and module mappers for our project structure.

JavaScript

/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  verbose: true,
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  preset: 'ts-jest',
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.tsx?$': ['ts-jest', {
      tsconfig: 'tsconfig.json',
    }],
  },
  moduleNameMapper: {
    '^@/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/client/src/$1',
  },
  testPathIgnorePatterns: [
    '/node_modules/',
    '/dist/',
    '/cypress/'
  ],
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/tests/setup.ts'], // Ensure you have a setup file for db connections if needed
  testTimeout: 30000,
};

export default config;
Part 2: Diagnose Cypress Configuration

Open the Cypress Config: Open the file cypress.config.ts.

Verify Setup: Ensure the e2e.setupNodeEvents is correctly configured and that the baseUrl is set to the application's running port (which should be handled by the development server). A standard configuration should look like this. Verify it and apply any necessary changes.

TypeScript

import { defineConfig } from "cypress";

export default defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:5173', // Ensure this matches your dev server port
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      // implement node event listeners here
    },
    specPattern: 'cypress/e2e/**/*.cy.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
    supportFile: 'cypress/support/e2e.ts',
  },
  video: false,
  screenshotOnRunFailure: true,
});
Part 3: Execute Tests Correctly

Run Backend Tests: After fixing the Jest config, run the full backend suite with one command. This will test all .test.ts files.
Bash

npx jest
Run Frontend E2E Tests: After fixing the Cypress config, run the full E2E suite.
Bash

npx cypress run
Provide me with the complete, raw output from these two commands. Do not summarize the results. The pass/fail logs are the only acceptable outcome.
