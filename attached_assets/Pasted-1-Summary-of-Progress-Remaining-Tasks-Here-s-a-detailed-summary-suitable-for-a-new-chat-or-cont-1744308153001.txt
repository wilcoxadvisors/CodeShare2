1. Summary of Progress & Remaining Tasks:

Here’s a detailed summary suitable for a new chat or context:

Goal: Build a scalable SaaS accounting platform.
Phase 1 (Stabilization): COMPLETE (DB migration, code cleanup).
Phase 2 (Guided Setup): COMPLETE (3-step "Add Client" flow stable).
Phase 3 (Core Accounting): IN PROGRESS
Chart of Accounts (CoA - Task B.1):
✅ Backend/Frontend hierarchy display implemented.
✅ Import/Export (CSV/Excel) fixed and verified.
✅ Update logic fixed: Now correctly allows updating name, active, parentId, description even if transactions exist, while still blocking accountCode/type changes and deletion if transactions exist. UI disables restricted fields appropriately.
🔄 Remaining: Final UI/UX review, documentation.
Journal Entries (JE - Task B.2):
✅ Manual JE workflow largely functional: Create (Draft/Post), Edit (Draft), Post, Void (Admin-only, requires reason), Reverse (creates Draft). UI updates correctly on status changes.
✅ JE List Display: Totals, Reference, Database ID fixed.
✅ JE Form: Buttons fixed (Save Draft/Post/Submit logic), Input bugs fixed, Number formatting fixed (decimals, thousand separators).
✅ Edit Route (/journal-entries/edit/:id): Fixed (was 404).
⏳ Attachments (#7): Implementation attempted but failed testing badly (multi-upload, list, download, delete all broken). Needs systematic debugging, starting with backend save/list & frontend fetch/render verification. User confirmed requirements (multi-file, drag-drop, delete, specific file types: PDF, images, office docs, txt, csv). Needs to be implemented within the JE Form, shown only in Edit mode.
🔄 Batch Upload: Pending implementation/verification.
🔄 Automated Testing: Pending implementation.
⏳ Auto-Reversal Feature: Requested by user, deferred.
Accounts Payable (Task B.3): NOT STARTED (Next priority after JE attachments/batch/testing).
Phase 4 (Website Content): NEARLY COMPLETE (Admin UI, Blog features mostly done).
Future Phases: Reporting (D), API Integrations (E), AI/ML (F), etc.
2. Proposed Update Text for Instructions.md:

Please ask the Replit agent to make the following modifications to the CodeShare/Instructions.md file:

Under Section 3, Phase 3 (Core Accounting Features):

Update Task B.1 (Chart of Accounts):
Change status from IN PROGRESS to NEARLY COMPLETE.
Add checkmarks or update descriptions for:
✅ Fixed account update logic to allow name/active/parentId changes with transactions, while correctly blocking accountCode/type changes.
✅ Fixed UI to disable restricted fields (accountCode/type) when editing accounts with transactions.
Keep items like 🔄 Finalize UI/UX enhancements... and 🔄 Ensure consistency... as pending.
Update Task B.2 (General Ledger / Journal Entries):
Keep status IN PROGRESS.
Add checkmarks or update descriptions for:
✅ Manual JE workflow functional: Create (Draft/Post), Edit (Draft), Post, Void (Admin, w/ reason), Reverse (creates Draft).
✅ JE List display fixed (Totals, Reference, ID).
✅ JE Form UI fixed (Buttons, Input stability, Number formatting).
✅ JE Edit route fixed.
Add a new pending item:
🔄 Implement/Fix File Attachment functionality (#7 - multi-file, drag-drop, list, download, delete, persistence, type filter).
Keep items like 🔄 Finalize and verify batch journal entry upload... and 🔄 Expand comprehensive automated testing... as pending.
(Optional) Under Section 5 (General Guidelines for Agent / Prioritize):

Maybe update the next priority to explicitly mention debugging/completing the JE Attachment feature (#7) before moving fully to Task B.3 (Accounts Payable).
