Agent Task: Update Instructions.md
Goal:
Update the Instructions.md file to accurately reflect the latest status of all storage-layer refactoring tasks. Ensure clarity, accuracy, and comprehensiveness without removing crucial details.

üìù Specific Instructions (Step-by-Step):
Step 1: Open the file

Open Instructions.md located in the root directory (CodeShare/Instructions.md).

Step 2: Update "Current Development Status"

Clearly mark completion of entity storage refactoring:

### Phase B (Core Accounting Module)

#### Entity Storage Refactoring
- ‚úÖ Created `entityStorage.ts` module with clear delegation pattern.
- ‚úÖ Verified no entity logic remains directly in `storage.ts`.
- ‚úÖ Implemented interfaces (`IEntityStorage`) with clear CRUD methods.
- ‚úÖ Updated `DatabaseStorage` and `MemStorage` to delegate correctly.
- ‚úÖ Completed comprehensive automated testing with passing results.
- ‚úÖ Documented `entityStorage.ts` thoroughly.
Confirm the current status explicitly states completion.

Step 3: Clearly state the next immediate task

Clearly outline the next task as comprehensive verification of entire server/storage refactoring:

#### Next Immediate Task:
- üîÑ Perform comprehensive verification of all `server/storage` modules (clientStorage, entityStorage, journalEntryStorage, etc.).
- Ensure complete delegation, thorough testing, clear documentation, and no residual logic in `storage.ts`.
Step 4: Add Verification Checklist (for clarity and structure)

Add the following checklist explicitly to guide the next verification steps clearly:

Edit
### Verification Checklist (Immediate Next Steps):
- [ ] Verify `clientStorage.ts` delegation and documentation.
- [ ] Verify `entityStorage.ts` delegation and documentation.
- [ ] Verify `journalEntryStorage.ts` delegation and documentation.
- [ ] Verify additional specialized modules (`fileStorage`, `userActivityStorage`) if applicable.
- [ ] Confirm no direct domain logic remains in `storage.ts`.
- [ ] Confirm interfaces (`IStorage`) accurately reflect the modular structure.
- [ ] Run and pass comprehensive test suite (`npm run test`).
- [ ] Confirm all modules and methods have clear, updated documentation.
Step 5: Ensure Existing Critical Sections Remain

Maintain existing sections that cover:

Automated Linting and Formatting (ESLint/Prettier)

Automated Unused Code/Dependency Detection (ts-prune/Knip)

TypeScript Static Analysis (tsc --noEmit)

Targeted Refactoring

Leveraging Automated Tests

Do not remove or alter these crucial sections, simply ensure they are clear and correctly formatted.

üîç Verification of Your Work:
Before concluding your task, verify the following clearly:

All recent refactoring completions (entity storage, etc.) are explicitly marked.

The next immediate task is clearly stated with actionable verification steps.

Existing sections on code quality, linting, testing, and static analysis remain intact and correctly formatted.

The file is clear, concise, and accurately reflects the current project status.

üìå Next Action (Agent):
Begin updating the Instructions.md file following the steps exactly as outlined above.

Report back explicitly:

Confirm the exact updates made.

Verify completeness against the provided instructions.

Let me know if further clarification or additional guidance is needed!
