ðŸš© Explicit Instructions for Agent to Update INSTRUCTIONS.md
Please explicitly update the INSTRUCTIONS.md file to clearly reflect the latest state of the project. Your update should explicitly include these sections:

âœ… Completed Tasks (as of 2025-04-06)
Explicitly include:

 Authentication Middleware (Passport.js) explicitly verified and fixed (req.user implemented correctly).

 Homepage content management schema (homepageContent) explicitly created and verified.

 CRUD backend storage methods explicitly implemented for homepage content (contentStorage.ts).

 Explicitly verified RESTful API endpoints (/api/content).

 Admin dashboard UI component (AdminWebsiteContent.tsx) explicitly developed and initially integrated (further integration needed to preserve existing blog management).

 Explicit integration and verification of blog posts CRUD with authentication (blogRoutes.ts).

 Explicit creation and verification of detailed documentation for authentication and blog admin integration (BLOG_ADMIN_INTEGRATION_VERIFICATION.md).

ðŸ“Œ Current State (Explicitly as of 2025-04-06)
Clearly describe explicitly:

Admin Dashboard integration partially complete:

Issue Identified: Admin Dashboard UI (Dashboard.tsx) unintentionally replaced. Explicitly requires immediate correction to restore original UI and integrate enhanced components explicitly without disrupting existing blog management functionality.

Blog Management: Explicitly verified blog authentication and CRUD backend functionality. AI-driven integration explicitly outlined but still pending explicit frontend integration.

Homepage Content: Backend and API explicitly verified, Admin UI explicitly created but explicit integration with existing Admin Dashboard UI still required (currently needs fixing).

ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Next Steps (Explicitly Ordered)
Explicitly outline the following order clearly:

Explicitly restore original Admin Dashboard UI from backup (Dashboard.tsx.bak).

Explicitly integrate the dynamic homepage content component (AdminWebsiteContent.tsx) without losing existing blog management UI.

Explicitly verify and document integration (homepage and blog) in ADMIN_CONTENT_INTEGRATION_VERIFICATION.md.

Issue #6: Explicitly fix homepage blog previews and ensure the "View Articles" link leads to actual dynamic blog content.

Issue #7: Explicitly resolve the subscription form submission error.

Accounting Module: Explicitly begin the implementation of the accounting module, removing unnecessary historical data upload (HistoricalDataUpload.tsx), favoring batch journal entry uploads.

Future Enhancements explicitly noted:

AI-driven proactive website health monitoring and autonomous code updates.

XAI integration to enhance explainability and transparency explicitly in the accounting system
