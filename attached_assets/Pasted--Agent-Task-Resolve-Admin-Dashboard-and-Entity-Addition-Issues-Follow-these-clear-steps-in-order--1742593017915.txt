 Agent Task: Resolve Admin Dashboard and Entity Addition Issues
Follow these clear steps in order:

Step 1: Diagnose Dashboard Loading Issue

Review the server-side logs (console.log, console.error) when the admin attempts to log in and access the dashboard.
Identify any authentication or permission errors.
Verify admin authentication middleware/routes, ensuring the currentUser object is properly populated.
Action (agent should):

Clearly log errors in authentication middleware or dashboard route handlers.
Step 2: Verify Dashboard API Endpoints

Check the API endpoint (GET /api/admin/dashboard) for data fetching issues.
Ensure it returns correct, expected data in the format:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "entities": [],
    "consolidationGroups": []
  }
}
Action (agent should):

Fix any API response errors or incorrect data structure.
Ensure proper handling of empty states or missing data.
Step 3: Resolve Entity Addition Issue

Verify the API endpoint responsible for adding entities (POST /api/entities) is correctly configured.
Confirm Zod input validation and correct junction-table insertion logic is in place:
typescript
Copy
Edit
await db.insert(consolidationGroupEntities)
  .values({ groupId, entityId })
  .onConflictDoNothing();
Action (agent should):

Implement clear error logging for validation or insertion issues.
Test the endpoint separately using known valid data.
Step 4: Integrate Frontend and Backend Logic

Ensure the frontend dashboard form submissions (to add entities) properly call the updated backend API.
Confirm all frontend API calls include correct payloads and handle API responses properly.
Action (agent should):

Verify frontend forms send accurate data payloads.
Clearly log frontend API errors.
üõ†Ô∏è Agent Completion Checklist
 Check and resolve authentication middleware issues.
 Confirm dashboard API returns correct, consistent data.
 Validate the entity-addition endpoint is fully functional (junction table integration).
 Ensure frontend integration correctly interacts with backend endpoints.
