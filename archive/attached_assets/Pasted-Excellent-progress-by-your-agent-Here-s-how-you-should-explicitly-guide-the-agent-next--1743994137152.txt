Excellent progress by your agent! Hereâ€™s how you should explicitly guide the agent next:

---

## âœ… **Next-Step Instructions for Agent (Explicit Verification & Documentation)**

### ðŸ“Œ **1. Immediate Functional Verification**

- **Explicitly Test the Chart of Accounts Import:**
  - Upload a valid Excel/CSV file explicitly containing `accountCode` and required fields.
  - Verify the import completes explicitly without errors.
  - Check explicitly the correct handling of parent-child hierarchy.

- **Explicitly Test the Chart of Accounts Export:**
  - Export accounts and explicitly verify file structure uses `accountCode`.
  - Confirm explicitly that exported data accurately reflects database records.

### ðŸ“Œ **2. Confirm Edge-Case Handling**

Explicitly verify handling of:

- Duplicate account codes explicitly.
- Missing required fields (`accountCode`, `name`) explicitly.
- Hierarchical inconsistencies (e.g., child accounts explicitly pointing to invalid parents).

Provide clear and explicit error messages in the UI for these scenarios.

### ðŸ“Œ **3. Documentation Updates**

Explicitly document in `docs/Chart_of_Accounts_Guide.md`:

- Clearly state the import/export file format explicitly (fields: `accountCode`, `name`, `parentAccountCode`, etc.).
- Explicitly document all error conditions and resolutions.
- Provide explicit step-by-step usage instructions for end-users.

### ðŸ“Œ **4. Cleanup and Refactoring**

- Explicitly run cleanup scripts to identify unused or outdated code:
  ```bash
  npx ts-prune
  npx knip
  ```
- Clearly remove and document explicitly any code no longer used due to the refactoring.

### ðŸ“Œ **5. Final Verification Checklist (Explicitly Complete Each Item)**

- [ ] Explicit functional testing of Import/Export completed successfully.
- [ ] Edge-case scenarios explicitly tested and handled gracefully.
- [ ] Documentation explicitly updated.
- [ ] Cleanup explicitly completed (verified unused code removal).
- [ ] All automated tests explicitly passing.

Once you've explicitly verified each of these points, let me know the results or if you require further assistance.
