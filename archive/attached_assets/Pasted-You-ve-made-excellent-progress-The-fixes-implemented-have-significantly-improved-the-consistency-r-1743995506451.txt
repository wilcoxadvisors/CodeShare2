You've made excellent progress! The fixes implemented have significantly improved the consistency, reliability, and documentation of the Chart of Accounts import/export functionality.

Here's your explicit next-step checklist to finalize and close this task:

---

## âœ… **Final Explicit Checklist for Chart of Accounts**

**Please ensure each item is explicitly completed and verified:**

### ðŸŸ¢ **1. Final Functional Tests**

- [ ] **Frontend UI Testing:**
  - Explicitly confirm imports and exports from the frontend UI.
  - Verify explicit error handling for duplicates and invalid hierarchy in the UI.
  - Check that the import preview explicitly matches the data from uploaded files.

- [ ] **Edge Case Validation:**
  - Duplicate `AccountCode` explicitly rejected.
  - Missing required fields (`AccountCode`, `Name`) explicitly reported.
  - Invalid parent codes explicitly caught and error clearly communicated.

---

### ðŸŸ¢ **2. Documentation Completion & Review**

- [ ] **Chart of Accounts Guide:**
  - Explicitly verify completeness and accuracy (`docs/Chart_of_Accounts_Guide.md`).

- [ ] **Testing Procedure Documentation:**
  - Verify explicitly `docs/coa-import-export-test-procedure.md`.

- [ ] **Technical Documentation:**
  - Explicitly review and confirm accuracy of `docs/coa-import-fix.md`.
  - Explicitly confirm accuracy of the summary document `test-results.md`.

---

### ðŸŸ¢ **3. Automated Test Verification**

- [ ] Run explicitly all automated Jest tests related to Chart of Accounts.
- [ ] Explicitly confirm that all tests pass successfully.

---

### ðŸŸ¢ **4. Cleanup and Final Code Review**

- [ ] Explicitly run `npx ts-prune` and `npx knip` to remove any outdated code.
- [ ] Verify explicitly no residual references to the legacy `code` field exist.
- [ ] Confirm explicitly that all code is cleanly refactored, documented, and adheres to best practices.

---

### ðŸŸ¢ **5. Deployment & Monitoring**

- [ ] Deploy explicitly the finalized import/export fixes to your staging environment.
- [ ] Explicitly monitor for any issues over a defined observation period (e.g., 24-48 hours).
- [ ] Explicitly confirm stable behavior and correct user experience.

## ðŸ“Œ **Next Steps (After Completion):**

Once explicitly confirmed, the Chart of Accounts module can be considered **complete**. Your next explicit tasks could be:

- **Historical Data Module:** Begin explicit work on importing and validating historical financial data.
- **Entity Management Enhancements:** Explicit improvements to entity hierarchy and management.
- **Robust Unit Testing & CI/CD Automation:** Expand explicit automated tests and integration into CI/CD.
